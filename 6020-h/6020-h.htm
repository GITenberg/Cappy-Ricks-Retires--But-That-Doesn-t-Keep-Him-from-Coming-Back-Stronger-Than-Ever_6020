    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you have read previous tales of the Blue Star Navigation Company and
      the various brisk individuals connected therewith, you will recall one
      Michael J. Murphy, who first came to the attention of Cappy Ricks at the
      time he, the said Murphy, was chief kicker of the barkentine <i>Retriever</i>
      under Captain Matt Peasley. Subsequently, when Matt Peasley presented in
      his person indubitable evidence of the wisdom of the old saw that you
      cannot keep a good man down, Michael J. became skipper of the <i>Retriever</i>.
      This berth he continued to occupy with pleasure and profit to all
      concerned, until a small financial tidal wave, which began with Matt
      Peasley's purchase, at a ridiculously low figure, of the Oriental
      Steamship Company's huge freighter, <i>Narcissus</i>, swept the cunning
      Matthew into the presidency of the Blue Star Navigation Company; whereupon
      Matt designed to take Murphy out of the <i>Retriever</i> and have him try
      his hand in steam as master of the <i>Narcissus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same financial tidal wave had swept Cappy Ricks out of the presidency
      of the Blue Star Navigation Company&mdash;presumably far up the beach to a
      place in the sun, where he was to bask for the remainder of his old age as
      president emeritus of all his companies. However, if there was one thing
      about Cappy you could depend upon absolutely it was the consistency of his
      inconsistency. For, having announced his retirement, his very next move
      was to bewail his inability to retire. He insisted upon clinging to the
      business like a barnacle to a ship, and was always very much in evidence
      whenever any deal of the slightest importance was about to be consummated.
      Indeed, he was never so thoroughly in command as when, his first burst of
      enthusiasm anent the acquisition of the <i>Narcissus</i> at fifty per
      cent. of her value having passed, he discovered that his son-in-law
      planned to order Mike Murphy off the quarter-deck of the <i>Retriever</i>
      onto the bridge of the <i>Narcissus</i>, while an unknown answering to the
      name of Terence Reardon had been selected for her chief engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy listened to Matt Peasley's announcement; then with a propitiatory
      &ldquo;Ahem! Hum! Harump-h-h-h!&rdquo; he hitched himself forward in his chair and
      gazed at Matt over the rims of his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Matt,&rdquo; he demanded presently, &ldquo;who is this man Reardon? I do not
      recall such an engineer in our employ&mdash;and I thought I knew them
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not in our employ, sir. He has been chief engineer of the <i>Arab</i>
      for the past eight years, and prior to that he was chief of the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      It was Reardon who told me what ailed her. She's a hog on coal, and the
      Oriental steamship people used to nag him about the fuel bills. Their port
      engineer didn't agree with Reardon as to what was wrong with her, so he
      left. He assures me that if her condensers are retubed she'll burn from
      seven to ten tons of coal less per day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! So you're going to give him the job for telling you something our
      own port engineer would have told us after an examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I'm going to give him the job because he has earned it. He gave
      me some very valuable information about the wretched condition of her
      electric-light plant and a crack, cunningly concealed, in the after web of
      her crank shaft&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by thunder,&rdquo; piped Cappy, &ldquo;that's worth knowing! Ship a new crank
      shaft, Matt, and save the Blue Star a salvage bill sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that inside information will not only save us money in the future,&rdquo;
       Matt continued, &ldquo;but it enabled me to drive a closer bargain when dealing
      with MacCandless, of the Oriental Steamship Company. Consequently Terence
      Reardon gets the job. He's only making a hundred and fifty dollars a month
      in the <i>Arab</i>, and as he is a rattling good man&mdash;I've looked him
      up, sir&mdash;I've promised him a hundred and seventy-five a month in the
      <i>Narcissus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've already promised him the job, eh? Mistake, Matt, serious
      mistake. You say you looked him up, but I'll bet you a new hat there is
      one thing about him that you failed to investigate, and that is: What kind
      of Irish is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, regular Irish, of course&mdash;mighty good Irish, I should say.
      Keen, observing, not too talkative, a hard worker, temperate in his habits
      and a crackajack engineer to boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy settled back wearily in his chair and favored his youthful partner
      with a glance of tolerant amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;those are the qualifications we look for in an
      engineer, and it's been my experience that the Irish and the Scotch make
      the best marine engineers in the world. But when you've been in the
      shipping game as long as I have, young man, you'll know better than to
      pick two Irishmen as departmental chiefs in the same ship! I did it&mdash;once.
      There was a red-headed scoundrel named Dennis O'Leary who went from A.B.
      to master in the <i>Florence Ricks</i>. That fellow was a bulldog. He made
      up his mind he was going to be master of the <i>Florence</i> and I
      couldn't stop him. Good man&mdash;damned good! And there was a black
      Irishman, John Rooney, in the <i>Amelia Ricks</i>. Had ambitions just like
      O'Leary. He went from oiler to first assistant in the <i>Amelia</i>. Fine
      man&mdash;damned fine! So fine, in fact, that when the chief of the <i>Florence</i>
      died I shifted Rooney to her immediately. And what was the result? Why,
      riot, of course. Matt, the Irish will fight anybody and anything, but
      they'll fight quicker, with less excuse and greater delight, among
      themselves, than any other nationality! The <i>Florence Ricks</i> carried
      a million feet of lumber, but she wasn't big enough for Rooney and
      O'Leary, so I fired them both, not being desirous of playing favorites.
      Naturally, each blamed the other for the loss of his job, and without a
      word having been spoken they went out on the dock and fought the bloodiest
      draw I have ever seen on the San Francisco waterfront. After they had been
      patched up at the Harbor Hospital, both came and cussed me and told me I
      was an ingrate, so I hired them both back again, put them in different
      ships, slipped each of them a good, cheerful Russian Finn, and saved
      funeral expenses. That's what I got, Matt, for not asking those two what
      kind of Irish they were. Now, then, sonny, once more. What kind of Irish
      is Terence Rearden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know, I tell you. He's just Irish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy lifted his eyes to the ceiling as if praying for the great gift of
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to the boy,&rdquo; he demanded of an imaginary bystander. &ldquo;He doesn't
      know! Well, stick your head down over his engine-room grating some day,
      sing The Boyne Wather&mdash;and find out! Now, then, do you happen to know
      what kind of Irish Mike Murphy is? You ought to. You were shipmates with
      him in the <i>Retriever</i> long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mike's from Galway. He goes to mass on Sunday when he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! If he's from Galway, where did he leave his brogue? He runs to the
      broad <i>a</i> like an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easily explained. Mike left his brogue in Galway. He came to this
      country when he was six years old and was raised in Boston. That's where
      he picked up his broad <i>a</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't help a bit, Matt. He's Irish just the same, and what a
      Yankee like you don't know about the Irish would fill a book. You know,
      Matt, there are a few rare white men that can handle Chinamen
      successfully; now and then you'll run across one that can handle niggers;
      but I have never yet met anybody who could figure the mental angles of the
      Irish except an Irishman. There's something in an Irishman that drives him
      into the bandwagon. He's got to be the boss, and if he can't be the boss
      he'll sit round and criticize. But if I want a man to handle Chinamen, or
      niggers, or Japs, or Bulgarians I'll advertise for an Irishman and take
      the first one that shows up. A young man like you, Matt, shouldn't monkey
      with these people. They're a wonderful race and very much misunderstood,
      and if you don't start 'em right on the job you'll always be in trouble.
      Now, Matt, I've always done the hiring and firing for the Blue Star
      Navigation Company, and as a result I've had blamed little of it to do,
      considering the size of our fleet; consequently I'll just give these two
      Harps the Double-O. Have Murphy and Reardon at the office at nine o'clock
      to-morrow morning and I'll read them the riot act before turning them to.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks was at his office at eight-fifty the following morning. At
      eight-fifty-two Mr. Terence Reardon, plainly uncomfortable in a ready-made
      blue-serge Sunday suit purchased on the Embarcadero for twenty-five
      dollars, came into the office. He was wearing a celluloid collar, and a
      quite noticeable rattle as he shook hands with Cappy Ricks betrayed the
      fact that he also was wearing celluloid cuffs; for, notwithstanding the
      fact that he bathed twice a day, Mr. Reardon's Hibernian hide contained
      much of perspiration, coal dust, metal grit and lubricating oil, and such
      substances can always be washed off celluloid collars and cuffs. To his
      credit be it known that Terence Reardon knew his haberdashery was not <i>au
      fait</i>, for his wife never failed to remind him of it; but unfortunately
      he was the possessor of a pair of grimy hands that nothing on earth could
      ever make clean, and even when he washed them in benzine they always left
      black thumb prints on a linen collar during the process of adjustment. He
      had long since surrendered to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight-fifty-four Mike Murphy arrived. Murphy was edging up into the
      forties, but still he was young enough at heart to take a keen interest in
      his personal appearance, and a tailor who belonged to Michael's council of
      the Knights of Columbus had decked him out in a suit of English tweeds of
      the latest cut and in most excellent taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, captain,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks greeted him. &ldquo;Ahead of time as usual.
      Meet Mr. Terence Reardon, late chief of the <i>Arab</i>. He is to be a
      shipmate of yours&mdash;chief of the <i>Narcissus</i>, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Reardon, shake hands with Captain Mike Murphy. Captain Murphy has
      been in our employ a number of years as master of sail. The <i>Narcissus</i>
      will be his first command in steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terence Reardon, eh?&rdquo; echoed Mike Murphy pleasantly. &ldquo;That sounds like a
      good name. Glad to meet you, chief. What part of the old country are you
      from? The West?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wish was father to the thought, since Mike was from the West himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm from the Nort'&mdash;from Belfast,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon replied in a deep
      Kerry brogue, and extended a grimy paw upon the finger of which Mike
      Murphy observed a gold ring that proclaimed Mr. Terence Reardon&mdash;an
      Irishman, presumably a Catholic&mdash;one who had risen to the third
      degree in Freemasonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks saw that ring also, and started visibly. A Knight Templar
      himself, Terence Reardon was the last person on earth in whom he expected
      to find a brother Mason. He glanced at Mike Murphy and saw that the
      skipper was looking, not at Mr. Reardon, but at the Masonic emblem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, chief,&rdquo; Cappy hastened to interrupt. &ldquo;Have a chair, captain.
      Mr. Reardon, my son-in-law, Captain Peasley here, tells me you were chief
      of the <i>Narcissus</i> when she was on the China run for the Oriental
      Steamship Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon sat down heavily, set his derby hat on the floor beside him
      and replied briefly: &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Murphy excused himself and drew Matt Peasley out of the room. &ldquo;God
      knows,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;religion should never enter into the
      working of a ship, and I suppose I'll have to get along with that fellow;
      but did you mark the Masonic ring on the paw of the Far-Down? And on the
      right hand, too! The jackass don't know enough to wear it on his left
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's wrong about being a Mason?&rdquo; Matt protested. &ldquo;Cappy's a Mason
      and so am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong about it&mdash;with you and Cappy Ricks. That's your
      privilege. You're Protestants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe the chief's a Protestant, too,&rdquo; Matt suggested, but Mike
      Murphy silenced him with a sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that name?&rdquo; he queried, and laughed the brief, mirthless laugh of
      the man who knows. &ldquo;And he says he's from Belfast! Man, I could cut that
      Kerry brogue with a belaying pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mike,&rdquo; Matt interrupted, &ldquo;I never before suspected you were
      intolerant of a shipmate's private convictions. I must say this attitude
      of yours is disturbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm not a bigot,&rdquo; Murphy protested virtuously. &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you're a Catholic, and you resent Reardon because he's a
      Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. You're a Protestant, and don't I love you like a
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt thought he saw the light. &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It's because
      Reardon is an Irish Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost&mdash;but not quite. God knows I hate the Orangemen for what they
      did to me and mine, but at least they've been Protestant since the time of
      Henry VIII. But the lad inside there has no business to be a Protestant.
      The Lord intended him for a Catholic&mdash;and he knows it. He's a
      renegade. I don't blame you for being a Protestant, Matt. It's none of my
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley had plumbed the mystery at last. He had been reading a good
      deal in the daily papers about Home Rule for Ireland, the Irish
      Nationalists, the Ulster Volunteers, the Unionists, and so on, and in a
      vague way he had always understood that religious differences were at the
      bottom of it all. He realized now that it was something deeper than that&mdash;a
      relic of injustice and oppression; a hostility that had come to Mike
      Murphy as a heritage from his forbears&mdash;something he had imbibed at
      his mother's breast and was, for purposes of battle, a more vital issue
      than the interminable argument about the only safe road to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Matt murmured. &ldquo;Reardon, being Irish, has violated the national
      code of the Irish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've said it, Matt. They're Tories at heart, every mother's son of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;Tories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they're for England, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't blame them. So am I. Aren't you, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God forgive you,&rdquo; Mike Murphy answered piously. &ldquo;I am not. I'm for
      their enemies. I'm for anything that's against England. Ireland is not a
      colony. She's a nation. Man, man, you don't understand. Only an Irishman
      can, and he gets it at his mother's or his grandmother's knee&mdash;the
      word-of-mouth history of his people, the history that isn't in the books!
      Do you think I can forget? Do you think I want to forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Matt Peasley replied quietly; &ldquo;I think you'll have to forget&mdash;in
      so far as Terence Reardon is concerned. This is the land of the free and
      the home of the brave, and even when you're outside the three-mile limit I
      want you to remember, Mike, that the good ship <i>Narcissus</i> is under
      the American flag. The <i>Narcissus</i> needs all her space for cargo,
      Mike. There is no room aboard her for a feud. Don't ever poke your nose
      into Terence Reardon's engine-room except on his invitation or for the
      purpose of locating a leak. Treat him with courtesy and do not discuss
      politics or religion when you meet him at table, which will be about the
      only opportunity you two will have to discuss anything; and if Reardon
      wants to talk religion or politics you change your feeding time and avoid
      meeting him. I've taken you out of the old <i>Retriever,</i> Mike, where
      you've been earning a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month, to put you
      in the <i>Narcissus</i> at two hundred and fifty. That is conclusive
      evidence that I'm for you. But Terence Reardon is a crackajack chief
      engineer, and I want you to remember that the Blue Star Navigation Company
      needs him in its business quite as much as it needs Michael J. Murphy, and
      if you two get scrapping I'm not going to take the trouble to investigate
      and place the blame. I'll just call you both up on the carpet and make you
      draw straws to see who quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; replied the honest Murphy. &ldquo;If I can't be good I'll be as
      good as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant Cappy Ricks was just discovering what kind of Irish
      Mr. Terence Reardon was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most innocent remark brought him the information he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Murphy, whom you have just met, is to be master of the <i>Narcissus,</i>
      chief,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He's a splendid fellow personally and a most
      capable navigator, and like you he's Irish. I'm sure you'll get along
      famously together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy tried to smile away his apprehension, for a still small voice
      whispered to him and questioned the right of Terence Reardon to call him
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon's sole reply to this optimistic prophecy was a noncommittal
      grunt, accompanied by a slight outthrust and uplift of the chin, a pursing
      of the lips and the ghost of a sardonic little smile. Only an Irishman can
      get the right tempo to that grunt&mdash;and the tempo is everything. In
      the case of Terence Reardon it said distinctly: &ldquo;I hope you're right, sir,
      but privately I have my doubts.&rdquo; However, not satisfied with pantomime,
      Mr. Reardon went a trifle farther&mdash;for reasons best known to himself.
      He laved the corner of his mouth with the tip of a tobacco-stained tongue
      and said presently: &ldquo;I can't say, Misther Ricks, that I quite like the cut
      av that fella's jib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the Irish of it. A representative of any other race on earth
      would have employed the third person singular when referring to the absent
      Murphy; only an Irishman would have said &ldquo;that fella,&rdquo; and only a certain
      kind of Irishman could have managed to inject into such simple words such
      a note of scorn supernal. Cappy Ricks got the message&mdash;just like
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stay off his bridge, Reardon,&rdquo; he warned the chief. &ldquo;Your job is in
      the engine-room, so even if you and Captain Murphy do not like each other,
      there will be no excuse for friction. The only communication you need have
      with him is through the engine-room telegraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sor,&rdquo; Terence Reardon replied respectfully, &ldquo;I'll take it kindly av
      you to tell him to keep out av me engine-room. I'll have no skipper
      buttin' in on me, tellin' me how to run me engines an' askin' me why in
      this an' that I don't go aisy on the coal. Faith, I've had thim do it&mdash;the
      wanst&mdash;an' the wanst only. Begorra, I'd have brained thim wit' a
      monkey wrench if they tried it a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; Cappy remarked, &ldquo;I've had to fire more than one chief
      engineer who couldn't cure himself of a habit of coming up on the bridge
      when the vessel got to port&mdash;to tell the skipper how to berth his
      ship against a strong flood tide. I suppose that while we have steamships
      the skippers will always wonder how the vessel can possibly make steerage
      way, considering the chief engineers, while the chiefs will never cease
      marvelling that such fine ships should be entrusted to a lot of Johnny
      Know-Nothings. However, Reardon, I might as well tell you that the Blue
      Star Navigation Company plays no favorites. When the chief and the skipper
      begin to interfere with the dividends, they look overside some bright day
      and see Alden P. Ricks waiting for them on the cap of the wharf. And when
      the ship is alongside, the said Ricks comes aboard with five bones in his
      pocket, and the said skipper and the said chief are invited into the
      dining saloon to roll the said bones&mdash;one flop and high man out. Yes,
      sir. Out! Out of the ship and out of the Blue Star employ&mdash;for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you, sor. I hearrd you the first time,&rdquo; Terence Reardon replied
      complacently and reached for his pipe. &ldquo;All I ask from you is a square
      deal. I'll have it from the captain wit'out the askin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Reardon breathing his defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad we understand each other, chief. Just avoid arguments, political
      or religious, and treat the skipper with courtesy. Then you'll get along
      all right. Now with reference to your salary. The union scale is one
      hundred and fifty dollars a month&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggin' yer pardon for the intherruption, sor, but the young man promised
      me a hundhred an' siventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before the Blue Star Navigation Company took over the young man
      and his ship <i>Narcissus.</i> Hereafter you'll deal with the old man in
      such matters. I'm going to give you two hundred a month, Reardon, and you
      are to keep the <i>Narcissus</i> out of the shop. Hear me, chief&mdash;out
      of the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man can ordher me to do me djooty,&rdquo; said Terence Reardon simply. &ldquo;Tell
      the fine gintleman on the bridge to keep her out av the kelp, an' faith,
      she'll shtay out av the shop. Thank you kindly, sor. When do I go to
      wurrk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pay started this morning. The <i>Narcissus</i> goes on Christy's
      ways in Oakland Harbor at the tip of the flood this afternoon. Get on the
      ship and stay on her. It's a day-and-night rush job to get her in
      commission, and you'll be paid time and a half while she's repairing.
      Good-day and good luck to you, chief. Come in and see me whenever you get
      to port.&rdquo; And Cappy Ricks, most democratic of men, extended his hand to
      his newest employee. Terence Reardon took it in his huge paw that would
      never be clean any more, and held it for a moment, the while he looked
      fearlessly into Cappy's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a proud man I am to wurrk for you, sor,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;Tip-top
      serrvice for tip-top pay, an' by the Great Gun av Athlone, you'll get it
      from me, sor. If ever the ship is lost 'twill be no fault of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon's manner, as he thus calmly exculpated himself from the
      penalty for future disaster, indicated quite clearly that Cappy Ricks, in
      such a contingency, might look to the man higher up&mdash;on the bridge,
      for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Terence Reardon had departed Cappy Ricks called Mike Murphy into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, captain,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there are a few things I want to tell you. This
      man Reardon is a fine, loyal fellow, but he's touchy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about him,&rdquo; Murphy interrupted with a slight emphasis on the
      pronoun. Unlike Mr. Reardon he employed the third person singular and did
      not say &ldquo;that fella,&rdquo; for he had been raised in the United States of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already given the captain his instructions,&rdquo; Matt Peasley
      announced. &ldquo;He understands the situation perfectly and will conduct
      himself accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A small army of men swarmed over, under and through the huge <i>Narcissus</i>
      for the next three weeks, and the hearts of Cappy Ricks and Matt Peasley
      were like to burst with pride as they stood on the bridge with Captain
      Mike Murphy, while he ran the vessel over the measured course to test her
      speed, and swung her in the bay while adjusting her compass. She was as
      beautiful as money and paint could make her, and when Terence Reardon, in
      calm disregard of orders, came up on the bridge to announce his unbounded
      faith in the rejuvenated condensers and to predict a modest coal bill for
      the future, Mike Murphy so far forgot himself as to order the steward to
      bring up a bottle of something and begged Mr. Reardon to join him in three
      fingers of nepenthe to celebrate the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T'ank you, sor, but I never dhrink&mdash;on djooty,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon retorted
      with chill politeness, &ldquo;nor,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;wit' me immejiate superiors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A superficial analysis of this remark will convince the most sceptical
      that Mr. Reardon, with true Hibernian adroitness, had managed to convey an
      insult without seeming to convey it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that a pity!&rdquo; the skipper replied. &ldquo;We'll excuse you to attend to
      your duty, Mr. Reardon;&rdquo; and he bowed the chief toward the companion
      leading to the boat deck. The latter departed, furious, with an
      uncomfortable feeling of having been out-generaled; and once a good
      Irishman and true has undergone that humiliation it is a safe bet that the
      Dove of Peace has lost her tail feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an unmannerly chief engineer,&rdquo; Mike Murphy announced blandly, &ldquo;but
      for all that he's not without his good points. He'll not waste money in
      his department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A virtue which I trust you will imitate in yours, captain,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks
      snapped dryly. &ldquo;Is Reardon working short-handed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only while we're loading, when he'll need just enough men to keep steam
      up in the winches. When we go to sea, however, he'll have a full crew, but
      the fun of it is they'll be non-union men with the exception of the
      engineers and officers. The engineers will all belong to the Marine
      Engineers' Association and the mates to Harbor 15, Masters' and Pilots'
      Association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Matt Peasley declared quietly. &ldquo;We have
      union crews in all our other steamers, and the unions will declare a
      strike on us if we put non-union men in the <i>Narcissus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;if they find out. But they'll not. Besides, we're going
      to the Atlantic Coast, so why should we bring a high-priced crew into a
      low-priced market, Mr. Ricks? Leave it to me, sir. I'll load the ship with
      longshoremen entirely, and we'll sail with the crew of that German liner
      that came a few days ago to intern in Richardson's Bay until the European
      war is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not partial to the German cause,&rdquo; Matt Peasley announced. &ldquo;So I'll
      just veto that plan right now, Mike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, we're neutral,&rdquo; Cappy declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it pays to ship those Germans, Matt,&rdquo; Murphy continued. &ldquo;I confess
      I'm for the Germans, although not to such an extent that I'd go round
      offering them jobs just because they <i>are</i> Germans. But the minute I
      heard about that interned boat I said to myself: 'Now, here's a chance to
      save the <i>Narcissus</i> some money. The crew of that liner will all be
      discharged now that she is interned. However, the local unions will not
      admit them to membership and they cannot work on any Pacific Coast boat
      unless they hold union cards. Consequently they must seek other
      occupations, and as the chances are these fellows do not speak English,
      they're up against it. Also, they are foreigners who have paid no head tax
      when coming into the country, because they are seamen. They have the right
      to land and stay ashore three months, if they state that it is their
      intention to ship out again within that period; but if they do not so
      ship, then the immigration authorities may deport them as paupers or for
      failure to pay the head tax; and in that event they will all be returned
      to the vessel that brought them here, and the owners of the vessel will be
      forced to intern them and care for them.' Under the circumstances,
      therefore, I concluded they would jump at a job in an American vessel, for
      the reason that under the American flag they would be reasonably safe; and
      even if the <i>Narcissus</i> should be searched by a British cruiser, she
      would not dare take these Germans off her. Remember, we had a war with
      England once for boarding our ships and removing seamen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet,&rdquo; said Cappy Ricks, &ldquo;there's something in
      that, Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a splendid saving in the pay roll, let me tell you,&rdquo; the proud
      Murphy continued. &ldquo;I took the matter up at once with the German skipper
      and he fixed it for me, and mighty glad he was to get his countrymen off
      his hands. We get all that liner's coal passers, oilers, firemen, six
      deckhands and four quartermasters at the scale of wages prevailing in
      Hamburg. I know what it is in marks, but I haven't figured it out in
      dollars and cents, although whatever it is it's a scandal! It almost cuts
      our pay roll in half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you speak German, captain?&rdquo; Cappy queried excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not, sir&mdash;more's the pity. But the four quartermasters speak
      fair English, and I have engaged two good German-American mates who speak
      German. Reardon has shipped German-American engineers and some of his coal
      passers and firemen speak fair English. I've got two Native Son Chinamen
      in the galley and a Cockney steward. We'll get along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a rattling fine idea, too,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks declared warmly. &ldquo;Mike, my
      boy, you're a wonder. That's the spirit. Always keep down the overhead,
      Matt. That's what eats up the dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't agree to it if the <i>Narcissus</i> wasn't going to be
      engaged in neutral trade, or if she was carrying munitions of war to the
      Allies,&rdquo; Matt declared. &ldquo;I'd be afraid some of Mike's Germans might blow
      up the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; quoth Michael J. Murphy, &ldquo;if she was engaged in freighting
      munitions to England, it'd be a smart German that would get a chance to
      blow her up. I think I'd scuttle her myself first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mike, if your courage failed you,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks replied laughingly,
      &ldquo;I think we could safely leave the job to Terence Reardon.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      On that first voyage the <i>Narcissus</i> carried general cargo to
      northern ports on the West Coast. Then she dropped down to a nitrate port
      and loaded nitrate for New York, and about the time she passed through the
      Panama Canal the Blue Star Navigation Company wired its New York agent to
      provide some neutral business for her next voyage. Freights were soaring
      by this time, due to the scarcity of the foreign bottoms which formerly
      had carried Uncle Sam's goods to market, and Cappy Ricks and Matt Peasley
      knew the rates would increase from day to day, and that in consequence
      their New York agents would experience not the slightest difficulty in
      placing her&mdash;hence they delayed as long as they could placing her on
      the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the New York agents, realizing that higher freight
      rates meant a correspondingly higher commission for them on the charter,
      held off until the <i>Narcissus</i> had almost finished discharging at
      Hoboken before they closed with a fine old New York importing and
      exporting house for a cargo of soft coal from Norfolk, Virginia, to
      Manila, or Batavia. The charterers were undecided which of these two
      cities would be the port of discharge, and stipulated that the vessel was
      to call at Pernambuco, Brazil, for orders. The New York agents marvelled
      at this for&mdash;to them&mdash;very obvious reasons; but inasmuch as the
      charterers had offered a whopping freight rate and declined to do business
      on any other basis, and since further the agent concluded it was no part
      of his office to question the motives of a house that never before had
      been subjected to suspicion, he concluded to protect himself by leaving
      the decision to the owners of the <i>Narcissus</i>. Accordingly he wired
      them as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue Star Navigation Company,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;258 California St., San Francisco, Cal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have offer <i>Narcissus</i>, coal Norfolk Batavia or Manila, charterers
      undecided, Pernambuco for orders, ten dollars per ton. Shall we close?
      Answer.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;SEABORN&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      2 boards, 1&rdquo; x 8&rdquo; and up, and too great a percentage of 4&rdquo; x 6'-20' No. 1
      clear. And there were mighty few clear twenty-foot logs coming into the
      boom these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will a cat eat liver?&rdquo; declared Cappy Ricks. &ldquo;I should say we do
      accept. Why, man, she'll make forty thousand dollars on the voyage, and
      whether she goes to Batavia or Manila, we're certain to get a cargo back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll wire acceptance,&rdquo; Skinner replied, and paused long enough
      to make a notation on the message: &ldquo;O.K.&mdash;Ricks.&rdquo; Mr. Skinner meant
      nothing in particular by that. He was a model of efficiency, and that was
      his little way of placing the responsibility for the decision in the event
      that the wisdom of said decision should, at some future time, be
      questioned. Mr. Skinner never took unnecessary chances. He always played a
      safe game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to state here also that Matt Peasley was not in the office
      when that telegram arrived from Seaborn &amp; Company. If he had been this
      story would never have been written. He was down at Hunter's Point
      drydock, superintending the repairs to the steam schooner Amelia Ricks,
      which recently on a voyage to Seattle had essayed the overland route via
      Duxbury Reef. When Matt reached home that night he found his ingenious
      father-in-law fairly purring with contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matt, old horse,&rdquo; Cappy piped, &ldquo;I've chartered the Narcissus.
      Norfolk to Batavia or Manila with coal. Got a glorious price&mdash;ten
      dollars a ton. That's what we get for holding off until the last minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's encouraging,&rdquo; Matt answered pleasantly, and asked no further
      questions. He was obsessed with the engines of the <i>Amelia Ricks</i>. It
      was going to cost a lot of money to put them in condition again, and he
      remarked as much to Cappy. Thus it happened that they entered into a
      discussion of other matters, and the good ship <i>Narcissus</i>, having
      finished discharging her cargo of nitrate, dropped down to Norfolk, where
      Captain Michael J. Murphy proceeded to let a stream of coal into her at a
      rate that promised to load her fully in less than four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark, at this juncture, that Mike Murphy and Terence
      Reardon had, by this time, cast aside all appearance of even shirt-sleeve
      diplomacy. Diplomatic relations had, in fact, been completely severed.
      Crossing the Gulf Stream, Murphy had called the engine-room on the
      speaking-tube and politely queried if Mr. Reardon didn't think he could
      get a few more revolutions out of her. To this Mr. Reardon had replied
      passionately that if such a thing were possible he would have done it long
      ago without waiting to be told. He desired to inform Captain Murphy that
      he knew his business; whereupon Murphy had replied that he never would
      have guessed Mr. Reardon was that intelligent, judging by the face of him.
      In disgust Mr. Reardon had replied: &ldquo;Aw, go to&mdash;&rdquo; and then tried to
      close the speaking-tube before the captain would have the opportunity to
      retort. However, Michael J. knew his own mind, and, like all the Irish,
      was a marvel at repartee. Quick as was Terence Reardon, therefore, Michael
      J. Murphy was quicker. Perhaps all of his message had not been delivered
      before Reardon closed the tube, but the chief got enough of it for all
      practical purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught one word&mdash;&ldquo;Renegade&rdquo;; a word so terrible that it left the
      chief engineer speechless with fury, and before he could call the skipper
      a baboon, the golden opportunity was gone. He closed the tube with a sigh.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the <i>Narcissus</i> was loading, the Fates were keeping in reserve
      for Cappy Ricks, Matt Peasley and Mr. Skinner a blow that was to stun them
      when it fell. About the time the <i>Narcissus</i>, fully loaded, was
      snoring out to sea past Old Point Comfort, Matt Peasley came across
      Seaborn &amp; Company's telegram in the unanswered-correspondence tray on
      his desk. Five times he read it; and then, in the language of the poet,
      hell began to pop!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks came out of a gentle doze to find his big son-in-law waving
      the telegram under his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me?&rdquo; Matt Peasley bawled, for all the world as if
      Cappy was a very stupid mate and all the canvas had just been blown out of
      the bolt-ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you ask me, you big stiff?&rdquo; shrilled Cappy. He didn't know
      what was coming, but instinct told him it was awful, so he resolved
      instantly to meet it with a brave front. &ldquo;Don't you yell at me, young
      feller. Now then, what do you want to find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me the <i>Narcissus</i> was to drop in at Pernambuco
      for orders?&rdquo; roared Matt wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy pursed his lips and calmly rang for Mr. Skinner. He eyed the general
      manager over the rims of his spectacles for fully thirty seconds. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, what the devil's wrong with you of late? It's getting so I can't
      trust you to do anything any more. Tut, tut! Not a peep out of you, sir.
      Now then, answer me: Why didn't you tell me, Skinner, that the <i>Narcissus</i>
      was to call in at Pernambuco for orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read you the telegram, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner replied coldly, and pointed to
      the notation: &ldquo;O.K.&mdash;Ricks,&rdquo; the badge of his infernal efficiency. &ldquo;I
      read that telegram to you, sir,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and asked you if I should
      close. You said to close. I closed. That's all I know about it. You and
      Matt are in charge of the shipping and I decline to be dragged into any
      disputes originating in your department. All I have to say is that if you
      two can't run the shipping end and run it right, just turn it over to me
      and I'll run it&mdash;right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Completely vindicated, Mr. Skinner struck a distinctly defiant attitude
      and awaited the next move on the part of Cappy. The latter, thoroughly
      crushed&mdash;for he knew the devilish Skinner never made any mistakes&mdash;looked
      up at his son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what's your grouch against Pernambuco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for bawling you out that way,&rdquo; Matt replied, &ldquo;but I guess
      you'd bawl, too, if somebody who should have known better had placed a
      fine ship in jeopardy for you. It just breaks me all up to think you may
      have lost my steamer <i>Narcissus</i>&mdash;the first steamer I ever owned
      too&mdash;and to be lost on her second voyage under the Blue Star flag&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our <i>Narcissus</i>, if you please,&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;You gibbering
      jackdaw! Out with it! Where do you get that stuff&mdash;lose your steamer
      on her second voyage! Why, she's snug in Norfolk this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she only is,&rdquo; Matt almost wailed, &ldquo;she'll never be permitted to clear
      with that German crew aboard. Pernambuco for orders! Suffering sailor! And
      you, of all men, to put over a charter like that! Pernambuco! Pernambuco!
      Pernambuco&mdash;for&mdash;orders! Do you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't. It's over my head and into the bleachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, my dear Matt,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner struck in blandly, &ldquo;that I also
      fail to apprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you two ever go to school?&rdquo; Matt raved. &ldquo;Didn't you ever study
      geography? Why under the canopy should we waste our time and burn up our
      good coal steaming to Pernambuco, Brazil, South America, for orders? Let
      me put it to you two in words of one syllable: The <i>Narcissus</i> is
      chartered to carry a cargo of coal from Norfolk, Virginia, to Batavia or
      Manila. At the time of charter&mdash;and sailing&mdash;the charterers are
      undecided which port she is to discharge at, so they ask us to step over
      to Pernambuco and find out. Now, whether the vessel discharges at Batavia
      or Manila, her course in the Atlantic Ocean while en route to either port
      is identical! She passes round the Cape of Good Hope, which is at the
      extreme south end of Africa. If her course, on the contrary, was round
      Cape Horn or through the Straits of Magellan there might be some sense in
      sending her over to the east coast of South America for orders. But
      whether she is ordered to Manila or Batavia, the fact remains that she
      must put in to Durban, South Africa, for fuel to continue her voyage; so
      why in the name of the Flying Dutchman couldn't the charterers cable the
      orders to Mike Murphy at Durban? The <i>Narcissus</i> is worth a thousand
      dollars a day, so you waste a few thousand dollars worth of her time, at
      the very least, sending her to Pernambuco when a ten-dollar cablegram to
      Durban would have done the business! I suppose all you two brilliant
      shipping men could see was a ten-dollar-a-ton freight rate. Eh? You&mdash;landlubbers!
      A-a-g-r-r-h! I was never so angry since the day I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Matt ranted on, Mr. Skinner's classic features had been slowly
      taking on the general color tones of a ripe old Edam cheese, while at the
      conclusion of Matt's oration Cappy Ricks' eyes were sticking out like twin
      semaphores. He clasped his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Twelve Ragged Apostles!&rdquo; he murmured in an awed voice. &ldquo;There's a
      nigger in the woodpile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I very greatly fear,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner chattered, &ldquo;that you are mistaken, Mr.
      Ricks. Something tells me it's a German!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; Matt Peasley sneered. &ldquo;Skinner, take the head of the
      class. Really, I believe I begin to pick up signs of human intelligence in
      this sea of maritime ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Matt, quit your jawing and break the news to me quickly,&rdquo; Cappy
      pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you been reading the papers, sir? Australian and Japanese
      warships have been hunting for the German Pacific fleet for the past few
      weeks, and the Germans have been on the dodge. Therefore, they've been
      burning coal. They are only allowed to remain in a neutral port
      twenty-four hours, and can only take on sufficient coal and stores to
      enable them to reach the nearest German port. Consequently, since they
      have been afraid to enter a neutral port, for fear of giving away their
      position, it follows that they've had to stay at sea&mdash;and naturally
      they have run short of coal. A few steamers have cleared from San
      Francisco with coal, ostensibly for discharge at Chilean or Mexican ports,
      but in reality for delivery to the German fleet at sea, but even with
      these few deliveries, there is a coal famine. And now that the Pacific is
      getting too hot for it, the general impression is that the German fleet
      will try to get through the Straits of Magellan, for, once in the
      Atlantic, coal will be easier to get. More ships, you know; more
      ship-owners willing to take a chance for wartime profits&mdash;and they
      say Brazil is rather friendly to the German cause. We will assume,
      therefore, that the German secret agents in this country realize it is
      inevitable that Von Spee's fleet must be forced into the Atlantic; hence,
      in anticipation of that extremity, they are arranging for the delivery of
      coal to those harassed cruisers. The agent in Pernambuco is probably in
      constant communication with the fleet by wireless; the fleet will probably
      come ranging up the coast of South America, destroying British commerce,
      or some of the ships may cross over to the Indian Ocean and join the <i>Emden</i>,
      raiding in those waters. So the German secret agents charter our huge <i>Narcissus</i>,
      load her with ten thousand tons of coal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley paused and bent a beetling glance, first at Cappy Ricks and
      then at Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she to carry soft coal or anthracite?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; Cappy Ricks piped up sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. For the sake of argument we'll assume it's soft coal,
      because anthracite has not as yet become popular as steamship fuel. Well,
      we will assume our vessel gets to Pernambuco. If, in the meantime, the
      German admiral wirelesses his Pernambuco agent, 'Send a jag of coal into
      the Indian Ocean,' to the Indian Ocean goes the <i>Narcissus</i>, and
      presently she finds a German warship or two or three ranging along in her
      course. They pick her up, help themselves to her coal, give Mike Murphy a
      certificate of confiscation for her cargo, to be handed to the owners, who
      in this case will be good, loyal sons of the Fatherland and offer no
      objection&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks interrupted. &ldquo;And if, on the other hand, the German
      admiral says, 'Send a jag of coal to meet us in a certain latitude and
      longitude off the River Plate,' and Mike Murphy objects, that German crew
      on our <i>Narcissus</i> will just naturally lock Mike Murphy up in his
      cabin and take the vessel away from him! When they're through with her
      they'll give her back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so certain they'll have to lock him up in his cabin in order to
      get the ship,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner struck in, a note of alarm in his voice. &ldquo;Mike
      Murphy is so pro-German&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow! Wow! That hurts,&rdquo; Cappy wailed. &ldquo;So he is! I never thought of that.
      And now that you speak of it, I recall it was his idea, getting that crew
      of Germans aboard! He said it would cut down expenses. Holy mackerel,
      Matt; do you think it was a frameup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do, but&mdash;Mike Murphy wasn't in on it. You can bank on
      that. No piratical foreigner will ever climb up on Mike Murphy's deck
      except over Mike Murphy's dead body. According to the president emeritus
      there is more than one kind of Irish, but I'll guarantee Mike Murphy isn't
      the double-crossing kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A boy entered with a telegram. It was a day letter filed by Mike Murphy in
      Norfolk that morning, and Matt Peasley read it aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sailing at noon. Regret your failure take me into your confidence when
      deciding withdraw vessel from neutral trade. If orders send me to either
      of ports named in charter party and I am overhauled <i>en route</i>, that
      is your funeral. If orders conflict with charter party, as I suspect they
      may, that may be my funeral. Regretfully I shall resign at Pernambuco. You
      know your own business, and I cannot believe you would go it blind; if you
      change your mind before arrival Pernambuco, cable care American Consul and
      will do my best for you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;M. J. M.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Gappy Ricks sprang into the air and tried to crack his aged ankles
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-toed Prophet! Saved! Bully for Mike
      Murphy! Say, when that fellow gets back, if I don't do something handsome
      for him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley's scowls had been replaced by smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless his old Mickedonian heart!&rdquo; he said fervently. &ldquo;He thinks the
      coal is for that British fleet reported to be <i>en route</i> across the
      Atlantic to give battle to the German Pacific fleet; or for Admiral
      Craddock's Pacific fleet in case the Germans chase it back into the
      Atlantic. He knows that we know he is pro-German and for anything that's
      against England&mdash;and if he makes up his mind the coal is for the
      British fleet he'll resign before delivering it! By Judas, this would be
      funny if it wasn't so blamed serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be forewarned is to be forearmed,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner quoted sagely. &ldquo;It is
      most fortunate for us that Murphy's suspicions do us a grave injustice. We
      know now that he will call on the American consul at Pernambuco and ask
      for a cablegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and by thunder! we'll send it,&rdquo; Cappy declared joyously. &ldquo;Cable him,
      Skinner, to fire that German crew so fast one might play checkers on their
      coat tails as they go overside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to heaven I could wireless him to put back to New York and ship a
      new crew,&rdquo; Matt Peasley mourned. &ldquo;There's just a possibility that German
      crew of his may take over the ship on the high seas and not put into
      Pernambuco at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can only wait and pray,&rdquo; said Mr. Skinner piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks slid out to the edge of his chair and, pop-eyed with horror,
      gazed at his son-in-law over the rims of his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you're as cheerful as a funeral. Here we have this
      thing all settled, and you have to go to work and rip the silver lining
      out of our cloud of contentment. And the worst of it is, by golly, I think
      there's something in that theory of yours after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should always be prepared to meet the worst, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner
      admonished the president emeritus. &ldquo;While piracy as a practice practically
      perished prior to the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner! In the fiend's name, spare us this alliteration and humbug,&rdquo;
       Cappy fairly shrieked. &ldquo;You're driving me crazy. If it isn't platitude,
      it's your dog-gone habit of initialing things!&rdquo; He placed his old elbows
      on his knees and bowed his head in his hands. &ldquo;If I'm not the original Mr.
      Tight Wad!&rdquo; he lamented. &ldquo;But you must forgive me, Matt. I got in the
      habit of thinking of expense when I was young, and I've never gotten over
      it. You know how a habit gets a grip on a man, don't you, Matt? Oh, if you
      had only overruled me when I decided to save money by cutting out the
      wireless on the <i>Narcissus!</i> I remember now you wanted it, and I
      said: 'Well, what's the use? The <i>Narcissus</i> hasn't any passenger
      license and she doesn't have to have wireless&mdash;so why do something we
      don't have to do?' Skinner, you should have known enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am managing the lumber end of the business, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Skinner
      retorted icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what you're managing. You're my balance wheel. I've raised you
      for that very purpose. I've been twenty-five years breaking you in to your
      job of relieving me of my business worries&mdash;and you don't do it. No,
      you don't, Skinner. Don't deny it, now. You don't. I pay you to boss me,
      but do you do it? No, sir. You let me have my own way&mdash;when I'm round
      you're afraid to say your soul's your own. You two boys know blamed well
      I'm an old man and that an old man will make mistakes. It is your duty to
      watch me. I pay the money, but I don't get the service. When Matt argued
      with me about the wireless you sided in with me, Skinner. You've got that
      infernal saving habit, too&mdash;drat you! Don't deny it, Skinner. I can
      see by the look in your eye you're fixing to contradict me. You're as
      miserable a miser as I am&mdash;afraid to spend five cents and play safe&mdash;you
      penurious&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;fellow! Skinner, if you ever forget
      yourself long enough to give three hoots in hell you'll want one of them
      back. See now what your niggardly policy has done for us? At a time when
      we'd hock our immortal souls for a wireless to talk to Mike Murphy and
      tell him things, where are we?&rdquo; Cappy snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Up Salt Creek&mdash;without
      a paddle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; Matt said soothingly, &ldquo;As Skinner says, we can only wait and
      pray&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You two do the praying. I'm going to sit here and cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll hope for the best, Mr. Ricks. No more crying over spilled
      milk now. I'll figure out when the <i>Narcissus</i> is due at Pernambuco
      and cable Mike to let his crew go. And you know, sir, even if he should
      not receive our cablegram, we have still one hope left. True, it is a
      forlorn one, but it's worth a small bet. The crew of the <i>Narcissus</i>
      is not all German. There are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two pro-German Irishmen, two disinterested Native Son Chinamen and a
      little runt of a Cockney steward,&rdquo; Cappy sneered. &ldquo;And she carries a crew
      of forty, all told. Matt, those odds are too long for any bet of mine.
      Besides, Reardon and Murphy hate each other. A house divided against
      itself, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might bang each other all over the main deck,&rdquo; Matt replied
      musingly, &ldquo;but I'll bet they'll fight side by side for the ship. Of course
      we haven't known Terence Reardon very long; he may be a bad one after all;
      but Mike Murphy will go far. He's as cunning as a pet fox, and he may make
      up in strategy what he lacks in numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Irish are so filled with blarney&mdash;&rdquo; Skinner began, but Cappy cut
      him short with a terrible look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes some more of our silver lining,&rdquo; he rasped. &ldquo;Skinner, what are
      you? A kill-joy? Now, just for that, I'm going to agree with Matt. A man
      has got to believe something in this world or go crazy, and I prefer to
      believe that the ship is safe with those two Hibernians aboard&mdash;win,
      lose or draw. And I want you two to quit picking on me; I don't want the
      word '<i>Narcissus</i>' mentioned in my presence until the ship is
      reported confiscated by the British, if her coal is for the Germans, or by
      the Germans, if her coal is for the British&mdash;which it isn't&mdash;or
      until Mike Murphy reports at Manila or Batavia and cables us for orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you there, sir,&rdquo; Matt Peasley declared. &ldquo;I'm going to bank on
      the Irish, and refuse to believe it possible for the <i>Nar</i>&mdash;for
      a certain vessel flying our house-flag to be caught by the wrong warship,
      a couple of thousand miles off her course and with coal, or evidences of
      coal, in her cargo space. Buck up, Skinner. A little Christian Science
      here, boy. Just make up your mind no man in authority is going to come
      over the rail of the&mdash;of a certain vessel&mdash;and ask Mike Murphy
      or his successor <i>pro tem.</i>, for a look at his papers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she ever is confiscated on an illegal errand,&rdquo; Skinner mourned, &ldquo;and
      Mike Murphy has nothing more tangible than a dime-novel tale of coercion
      as an excuse for being in that latitude and longitude&mdash;well, we'll
      never get our bully big ship back again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for the first time in his life the efficient Mr. Skinner so far forgot
      himself as to swear in the office!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the long, lazy days that the <i>Narcissus</i> rolled into the
      South, Captain Michael J. Murphy's alert brain was busy every spare
      moment, striving to discover, in the incomprehensible charter his owners
      had made for him, what the French call <i>la raison d'etre.</i> Not having
      any wireless, he was unable to keep in touch with the stirring events
      being enacted in Europe and on the high seas, as news of the said events
      filtered by him through space. While on the West Coast, where all the
      newspapers are printed in Spanish, he had been equally barred from keeping
      in touch with the war, although <i>en route</i> through the Panama Canal
      he did his best to buy up all the old newspapers on the Zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arrival in New York with his cargo of nitrate, his anxiety to make a
      record in his first command in steam caused him to stay on the job every
      moment the <i>Narcissus</i> was discharging, for Cappy Ricks had impressed
      upon him, as he impressed upon every skipper in the Blue Star employ, the
      fact that a slow boat is slow paying dividends. Consequently, the worthy
      captain had had no time to acquaint himself with the movements of the
      various fleets, and when he sent his day letter to his owners on the
      morning of the day he sailed from Norfolk for Pernambuco, his action was
      predicated, not on what he knew, but on what he felt. The sixth sense that
      all real sailors possess warned him that his cargo of coal was not
      destined for Batavia nor yet Manila, but for delivery at sea to the
      warships of some foreign nation. Devoutly Michael J. hoped it wasn't for
      the British fleet, since in such a contingency he would be cruelly torn
      between his love and duty. Consequently he resolved that, should the
      choice of alternatives be forced upon him, he would steer a middle course
      and resign his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Mike Murphy knew Matt Peasley and Cappy Ricks to be
      intensely pro-Ally in their sympathies, despite the President's
      proclamation of neutrality and the polite requests of the motion-picture
      houses for their audiences to remain perfectly quiet while Field-Marshal
      von Hindenburg, Sir John French and General Joffre came on the screen and
      bowed. Under the circumstances, therefore, Murphy found it very difficult
      to suspect his owners of conspiring to deliver a cargo of coal to the
      German fleet at sea. No, indeed! Matt Peasley and Cappy Ricks were too
      intensely American for that; indeed, Cappy was always saying he hoped to
      see an American mercantile marine established before he should be gathered
      to the bosom of Abraham.
    </p>
    <p>
      From whatever angle the doughty skipper viewed it, therefore, the tangle
      became more and more incomprehensible. Cappy and Matt knew full well the
      rules of the game as promulgated by their Uncle Samuel, and the dire
      penalties for infraction. However, granted that they knew they could
      scheme successfully to evade punishment at the hands of their own
      government, Mike Murphy knew full well that no man could guarantee
      immunity from the right of a belligerent warship to visit and search, or
      from confiscation or months of demurrage in a prize court in the event
      that his ship's papers and the course the vessel was travelling failed to
      justify her presence in that particular longitude and latitude. And with
      the huge profits to be made in neutral trade, it seemed incomprehensible
      that a sound business man like Cappy Ricks should assume all these risks
      for the sake of a little extra money. Surely he must realize that if he
      sent her on an illegal errand her war-risk insurance would not hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it appeared to Murphy that the charter must have been
      consummated with the full knowledge and consent of the Blue Star
      Navigation Company, for the veriest tyro in the shipping business could
      not have failed to be suspicious of that clause in the charter party,
      stipulating a call at Pernambuco for orders. Of course there was the
      possibility that this acquiescence had been due to misrepresentation on
      the part of the New York agents or rank stupidity on the part of the Blue
      Star Navigation Company. But Seaborn &amp; Company were above a shady
      deal. In putting through the charter for the Blue Star Navigation Company
      it might have occurred to them that all was not as it should be, but that
      was none of their business. If they spread their hand and permitted Cappy
      Ricks an unobstructed view, it was up to Cappy to decide and order them to
      close or reject the charter. As for stupidity on the part of the Blue Star
      Navigation Company, Murphy knew full well that stupidity was the crime
      Cappy Ricks found it hardest to forgive. Even had Cappy overlooked that
      suspicious clause in the charter, because of his age, Matt Peasley's youth
      and practical maritime knowledge should have offset Cappy's error; and
      even if both had erred, there still remained the matchless Skinner, as
      suspicious as a burglar, as keen as a razor, as infallible as a
      chronometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it just didn't seem possible that the Blue Star Navigation Company had
      gone into the deal with eyes wide open; on the contrary, it seemed equally
      impossible that they had gone into it with their eyes shut. Consequently
      Michael J. decided to wake them up&mdash;provided they slept on the job&mdash;and
      to give them an opportunity to repent before it should be too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt very much better after sending that telegram, but as the <i>Narcissus</i>
      ploughed steadily south at the rate of two hundred and thirty miles a day,
      he began to grieve because he had no wireless to bring him a prompt reply;
      he berated himself for not waiting at the dock in Norfolk until his owners
      should have had an opportunity to answer; he abused himself for his
      timidity in questioning the judgment of his owners, for indeed he had been
      content to hint when more decisive action was demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Michael J. Murphy yearned to discuss his problem with some one as
      loyal and devoted to the Blue Star Navigation Company as himself! His
      dignity as master of the <i>Narcissus</i>, however, bade him refrain from
      discussing the integrity of his owners with his mates&mdash;particularly
      with new mates, to whom the house-flag stood for naught but a symbol of
      monthly revenue. In fact, of the forty-one men under him, there was but
      one with whom he could, with entire dignity, discuss the matter. That man
      was Terence Reardon. But even here he was barred, for since he had called
      the chief engineer a renegade, the only possible discussion that could
      obtain between them now must be anything but academic; in consequence of
      which Michael J. Murphy was forced to hug his apprehensions to himself
      until the <i>Narcissus</i> steamed slowly into the outer harbor of
      Pernambuco. Ten minutes after she dropped her big hook the skipper's
      suspicions were crystallized into certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she came to anchor the steward appeared on deck, vociferously
      beating his triangle to announce supper&mdash;for at sea dinner is always
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Schultz,&rdquo; the captain called from the bridge, &ldquo;as soon as your men
      have had their supper clear away the working boat. I'm going ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very vell, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Schultz replied heartily, and the captain went below
      to supper. He was scarcely seated before Mr. Schultz stuck his head in the
      dining saloon window and announced that a gentleman who claimed to
      represent the charterers was alongside in a launch and desired to come
      aboard and speak with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let down the accommodation ladder, Mr. Schultz, and when the gentleman
      comes aboard, show him round to my state-room,&rdquo; the skipper answered.
      &ldquo;I'll meet him there in a pig's whisper. It is probable he has come aboard
      with our orders, Mr. Schultz, so never mind clearing away the boat until I
      speak to you further about it. Steward, set an extra cover at my right. We
      may have a guest for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried round to his state-room and donned a uniform coat to receive
      his visitor. Mr. Schultz came presently, bearing a visiting-card upon
      which was engraved the name: Mr. August Carl von Staden. Behind the mate a
      sailor with a bulging suitcase stood at attention; two more sailors stood
      behind the first, a steamer trunk between them, and as Captain Murphy
      stepped out on deck to greet his visitor he observed a tall, athletic,
      splendid-looking fellow coming leisurely toward him along the deck. The
      stranger carried a large Gladstone bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain bowed. &ldquo;I am the skipper of this big box,&rdquo; he announced
      pleasantly. &ldquo;Murphy is my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Staden shook hands and in most excellent English, without the
      slightest trace of a German accent, expressed his pleasure in the meeting.
      The captain cast a glance of frank curiosity at the bag von Staden carried
      and at the baggage the sailors had in tow. Von Staden interpreted the
      glance and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought you your orders, Captain Murphy. They are contained in
      this envelope;&rdquo; and he handed a blank envelope to the captain. &ldquo;However, I
      happened to know that one of the orders is to provide a berth for me. I'm
      to go with you as supercargo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't heard anything about such a possibility,&rdquo; Mike Murphy replied,
      with just a shade of formality in his tones. He turned to the first mate:
      &ldquo;Mr. Schultz, will you be good enough to see to it that Mr. von Staden's
      baggage is stowed in the owners' suite. Then tell the steward to see that
      our guest's quarters are put in order. Mr. von Staden, will you kindly
      step into my stateroom here while I read these orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Staden nodded. Entering the captain's room he sat down on the settee
      and lighted a gold-tipped cigarette, while Murphy tore open the envelope.
      It contained a cablegram reading as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Von Staden &amp; Ulrich,&mdash;Pernambuco, Brazil,&mdash;Ornillo
      Montevideo.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;BLUESTAR.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The captain reached for his telegraphic-code book. When decoded the
      message read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instruct captain to proceed to Montevideo and there await further orders.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;BLUE STAR NAVIGATION COMPANY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The cablegram had been filed at San Francisco two days before. Murphy
      looked keenly at his guest, who smoked tranquilly and returned the look
      without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. von Staden,&rdquo; the captain announced, &ldquo;these are strange orders, in
      view of the fact that I cleared from New York for Manila or Batavia, via
      the Cape of Good Hope. It would be a sure sign of bad luck to the steamer
      <i>Narcissus</i> if a British cruiser should pick her up off the coast of
      Uruguay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Staden smiled. &ldquo;You are very direct, captain&mdash;very blunt indeed.
      This is a characteristic more Teutonic than Celtic, I believe, so I shall
      experience no embarrassment in being equally frank with you. Your cargo of
      coal is designed for our German Pacific fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed as much, sir. Nevertheless, my owners did not see fit to take
      me into their confidence in this illegal undertaking, Mr. von Staden&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not think it necessary,&rdquo; von Staden interrupted smilingly. &ldquo;In
      fact, Captain Peasley assured our people in New York that your sympathies
      are so overwhelming in favor of our cause we need anticipate no worry as
      to the course you would pursue. Moreover, in the event of a judicial
      inquiry it would be an advantage if you could say that you had had no
      voice in the matter, but had been instructed to obey the orders of the
      charterers&mdash;of whom we are the agents in Pernambuco. Perhaps this
      cablegram will allay your fears,&rdquo; and he drew an unopened cablegram from
      his pocket and handed it to Murphy. It was a code cablegram, signed by the
      Blue Star Navigation Company and addressed to Murphy in care of von Staden
      &amp; Ulrich. When decoded it read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Execute the orders of supercargo if possible. It may lead to further
      business. Charterers must take the risk. We do not think there is any
      risk. Please remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This cablegram was signed &ldquo;Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain?&rdquo; von Staden queried politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like this business at all,&rdquo; the captain replied. &ldquo;My owners may
      think there is no risk, but I'm afraid. England controls the seas&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in possession of the secret code of the British Navy, Captain
      Murphy. We know the approximate location of every British warship in the
      Atlantic and Pacific&mdash;and I assure you there is no risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boss informs me the charterers assume the risk, so I suppose I
      shouldn't worry over the Blue Star Navigation Company's end of the gamble.
      They know their own business, I dare say. Evidently they feared I might
      want to resign, so I have been asked to remain; and when Captain Peasley
      says 'please' to me, Mr. von Staden, I find it very, very hard to refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, for the sake of our selfish interests, my dear captain, to
      find you so loyal to your owners' financial interests,&rdquo; the supercargo
      replied heartily. &ldquo;Now that you have decided to remain, I need not point
      out to you the danger of a resignation at this time. It might lead to some
      unlooked-for developments which might prejudice your owners, although I
      think they have covered their tracks very effectually. Nevertheless, it is
      not well to take the slightest risk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without being well paid for it,&rdquo; Murphy interrupted sneeringly. &ldquo;My
      owners have been well paid for their risk, but where do I come in? I
      haven't been promised double my usual salary, or a split on the profits of
      the voyage; and I know if I were to command a vessel loaded with munitions
      of war I would not be asked to take her into the North Sea at the
      customary skipper's wages. I'd be offered a large bonus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, my dear captain, that your charterers assume all the risks.
      One of them was the risk that you might resign unless you received
      adequate compensation. I came aboard prepared to insure that risk,&rdquo; and he
      touched with his toe the Gladstone bag. &ldquo;What do you say to $5,000?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy smiled. &ldquo;It is pleasant, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be paid
      $5,000 for doing something one yearns to do for nothing. I am not a hog.
      Five thousand dollars is sufficient. How do I get it&mdash;and when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In gold coin of the United States, or gold certificates of the same
      interesting country, my dear captain, and you may have it immediately.&rdquo;
       Again Herr von Staden kicked the Gladstone bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it in gold certificates. And in order that my dear old father
      and mother may have the benefit of my rascality in case anything
      unforeseen should arise to prevent my return, I suggest you hand over the
      boodle this minute, and I'll go ashore and express it home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Murphy, you are a man after my own heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a born fool, sir,&rdquo; Murphy interrupted. &ldquo;I'm accepting this money
      to be a fool, well knowing it is foolish to do it, for still I am taking a
      risk. I am thirty-eight years old, Mr. von Staden, and a skipper as young
      as that has his future all before him. Set him down on the beach, however,
      with his ticket revoked for all time&mdash;and his future is behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that event,&rdquo; the supercargo replied, &ldquo;you might accept my assurance,
      without questioning my authority for such assurance, that you would have
      no difficulty in procuring a remunerative position ashore. The firm of von
      Staden &amp; Ulrich could use you very handily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. Consider the matter settled. Will you come ashore with
      me, sir, and dine, or would you prefer to have supper aboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you to be excused from going ashore, captain. I have much to do
      to-night. The launch which brought me alongside has a knocked-down
      wireless plant aboard, and I am anxious to have it set up on your good
      ship <i>Narcissus</i>&mdash;a task I shall have to oversee personally. I
      shall probably work all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise be!&rdquo; Michael J. Murphy answered heartily. &ldquo;We'll have some
      interest in life now. We can get all the war news, going and coming, can't
      we? Have you brought along an operator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an operator,&rdquo; the supercargo answered. &ldquo;By the by, can you fix me up
      with a wireless room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two staterooms and a bath in the owners' suite which you will
      occupy. You can take your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. I shall want to sleep close to my instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the bag, counted out five one-thousand-dollar gold certificates
      of the United States of America and handed them to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grand old rag,&rdquo; Michael J. murmured. &ldquo;How many rascals fight under
      the flag of old King Spondulics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you have an Irish chief engineer,&rdquo; von Staden continued. &ldquo;While
      I understand his sympathies are with us, still it seems only right to
      compensate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suit yourself, Mr. von Staden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a man is he, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd hate to tell you. I've had little to do with him, but that little was
      enough. We avoid each other as much as possible and never speak except in
      the line of duty. I make no bones of the fact that I think he's a scrub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. von Staden nodded sagely. &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better wait and get acquainted
      with him,&rdquo; he suggested, and closed his bag. Murphy showed him to his
      quarters, which the steward, under the first mate's supervision, was
      already setting in order; and, having decided to set up the wireless in
      the sleeping-room, von Staden accompanied the skipper round to superintend
      the taking on board of the wireless plant from the gasoline launch bobbing
      alongside. When the equipment was finally hoisted to the deck of the <i>Narcissus</i>,
      Michael J, Murphy boarded the launch and was whisked ashore for the avowed
      purpose of sending to his aged parents the fruits of his elastic
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr August Carl von Staden stood at the head of the accommodation ladder
      and smiled as the launch disappeared into the tropic twilight. Then he
      said something in German to Mr. Schultz, who laughed. Evidently it was
      very good news, for even the quartermaster at the companion ladder smiled
      covertly. It is possible they would not have felt so cheerful had they
      known that Michael J. Murphy's &ldquo;dear old father and mother&rdquo; had been
      sleeping in a Boston cemetery some fifteen years, and that their last
      words to Michael had been an exhortation to remember that manliness and
      honor must be his only heritage. And as the launch bore him shoreward, he
      looked back and grinned at the dim, duck-clad figure of von Staden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your agents looked me up, my hearty,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;and if they did
      their work half well, they told you I was an honest man. Only a crook
      comes with a bag of gold to talk illegitimate business with an honest man.
      I'm banking you're as crooked as a bed spring, and that there's something
      fishy about this enterprise. Cappy Ricks isn't fully informed, otherwise
      he wouldn't be doing business with a crook!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arrived ashore, Captain Murphy hurried to the cable office, registered his
      cable address, borrowed a code book and sent a code telegram to his owner.
      Then, having subsidized the operator liberally to rush it, Michael J.
      Murphy set out for a stroll among the limited attractions of Pernambuco.
      His cablegram would get through in two hours at the very most, and though
      the captain figured the Blue Star offices would be closed when the message
      reached San Francisco, still he was not discouraged. He knew the cable
      company always telephoned to Mr. Skinner, at his home, all Blue Star and
      Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging messages arriving after office hours and before
      midnight. Naturally Skinner could be depended upon to have a copy of the
      code at home, and if he didn't Murphy knew he would rush down to the
      office, no matter what the hour, and decode it there. Of course he would
      cable his reply immediately, in which event it might be that the captain
      would have an answer shortly after midnight or by breakfast at the latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided, therefore, to return to the cable office about midnight and
      await the reply to his cablegram. He had proceeded but a few blocks from
      the cable office, however, before a disturbing thought struck him with
      such force as to bring him to an abrupt pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>His owners had cabled him in care of von Staden &amp; Ulrich, when in
      the telegram sent just before sailing from Norfolk he had instructed them
      to cable him in care of the American consul.</i> Murphy's native
      shrewdness had made him suspicious of von Staden the instant the latter
      had so nonchalantly offered him a bribe of five thousand dollars, for the
      proffer of a bribe of that magnitude, without any preliminary bargaining,
      did not co-ordinate with Michael's idea of business. Certainly if the
      charterers had his owners &ldquo;fixed,&rdquo; five thousand dollars was too much
      money to give their captain, particularly since there were available any
      number of capable rascals eager to do the job for twenty-five hundred, and
      the devil take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time von Staden had handed him the two cablegrams from the Blue
      Star Navigation Company, no suspicion that they were forgeries had entered
      the captain's mind; indeed, Matt Peasley's cablegram to him appeared at
      first blush to be an answer to the telegram which Murphy had sent his
      owners from Norfolk. In that telegram Murphy had mentioned his suspicions
      and hinted at unwarranted risks and the possibility of the circumstances
      attending the delivery of his cargo forcing his resignation. Matt's
      cablegram handed him by von Staden urged him to remain in the ship and
      assured him there were no risks; that if there were, the charterers
      assumed them. For the nonce, therefore, the master's mind did not dwell on
      any doubts as to the genuineness of the orders he had received, even
      though he decided instantly as a precautionary measure to confirm them
      before proceeding to carry them out. This, however, was merely because he
      was suspicious of von Staden and desired to obviate the possibility of
      that individual's double-crossing the Blue Star Navigation Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the circumstances, therefore, he had considered it good policy to
      appear to fall readily in line, and, the better to disarm von Staden's
      watchfulness, he had demanded extra compensation. The ease with which the
      bribe had been secured having crystallized his suspicions, instantly he
      had cast about in his ingenious brain for a good sound excuse for going
      ashore and cabling his owners. To demand his bribe in advance and then
      announce that he would go ashore and express it to those dependent upon
      him, in case he failed to return and enjoy it himself, seemed to present a
      reason that would not be questioned and accordingly he had done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy removed his uniform cap and thoughtfully scratched his
      head. &ldquo;Now why,&rdquo; he demanded of the scented night, &ldquo;did Matt cable me in
      care of that German firm when he must have known I would call on the
      American consul in the expectation of finding a cablegram there?&rdquo; He shook
      his head. &ldquo;They've got us winging, Michael,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;so I
      suppose the only thing to do is to play safe, call upon the American
      consul immediately if not sooner, and ask if he has a cablegram for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without further ado the worthy fellow sprang into a cab and was
      whirled away to the residence of the American consul. Yes, the consul had
      a cablegram for him, but it was at his office. Could Captain Murphy not
      wait until morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most emphatically Captain Murphy could not. That cablegram was important;
      it meant a great deal of money and possibly life or death&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Regretfully the consul entered the cab with the captain, drove to the
      consulate and delivered the cable-gram to the eager mariner, who swore
      when he discovered it was in cipher and not code, for this necessitated
      immediate return to the <i>Narcissus</i> in order to obtain the key to the
      cipher. He thanked the consul and sent the latter home in the cab, while
      he hurried for the harbor front and the nearest boat landing. He was
      filled with apprehension, for indeed there was something radically wrong
      when his owners cabled him in the secret cipher of the Blue Star
      Navigation Company&mdash;something the company had, doubtless, never found
      occasion to do before. For while each vessel of the Blue Star fleet had a
      copy of the A.L. code aboard, with the cipher key typewritten and pasted
      on the second fly-leaf, not a single Blue Star skipper knew why it had
      been pasted there or why the company should have gone to the trouble of
      getting up any one of the hundreds of secret ciphers possible to be
      developed from the A. L. Telegraphic Code. This was a secret that lay
      locked in the breast of Mr. Skinner. It is probable, however, that it had
      occurred to him in an idle moment that a secret cipher might come in handy
      some day, and Mr. Skinner believed in being prepared for emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain bade the launch wait for him at the accommodation ladder,
      while he hurried round to his state-room and promptly fell to work on Mr.
      Skinner's cipher cablegram. When he had laboriously deciphered it this is
      what he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unaccountably failed note suspicious clause charter. Something rotten. We
      are playing square game. Think plot deliver coal German fleet South
      Atlantic. Discharge your German crew immediately, first notifying
      Brazilian authorities and American consul. Have help when you notify them
      game is off, otherwise may take vessel away from you. They will stop at
      nothing; fleet desperate for coal. Cable acknowledgment these orders; also
      cable when orders fulfilled. Very anxious. 'BLUE STAR NAVIGATION
      COMPANY.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; breathed Michael J. Murphy softly, but very distinctly. &ldquo;So
      that's the game, eh?&rdquo; His big square chin set viciously; subconsciously he
      clenched his hard fist and shook it at his enemies. &ldquo;The cunning Dutch
      devils!&rdquo; he murmured very audibly, and at that precise instant Herr August
      Carl von Staden stood in the open doorway. He coughed, and Murphy glanced
      up from the translation of the cipher message just in time to note a swift
      shadow pass over the supercargo's face, a shadow composed of equal parts
      of suspicion, embarrassment and desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have returned very promptly, captain,&rdquo; he remarked smoothly, and then
      his restless glance fell on the cablegram and beside it the scratch pad
      and the two parallel columns of words scrawled on it. A man of far less
      intelligence than von Staden possessed would, have realized as quickly
      that the first column was composed of cipher words, while the second
      column was the translation. From this tell-tale evidence his suspicious
      glance lifted to the skipper's face, and he read in Michael J. Murphy's
      black eyes the wild rage which no Irishman could have concealed&mdash;which
      the majority of his race would not even have taken the trouble to endeavor
      to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that glance each learned the other's secret; each realized that the
      success of his plans depended on the silence of the other; each resolved
      instantly to procure that silence at any cost. Von Staden reached for his
      hip pocket, but before he could draw his automatic pistol and cover the
      skipper, Michael J. Murphy had hurled ten pounds of code book into the
      geometric centre of the supercargo's face. It was the first weapon his
      hand closed over, and he did not disdain it. The instant it landed and von
      Staden reeled before the blow, Murphy came out of his state-room with a
      scuttering rush and von Staden fired as he came. The captain felt the
      sting of the bullet as it creased the top of his left shoulder; then his
      right fist came up in a blow that started at his hip and landed fairly
      under the supercargo's heart. Von Staden grunted once, the pistol dropped
      clattering to the deck and he folded up like an accordion. For him the
      battle was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so, however, with Mike Murphy. Gone to the winds now was the caution
      he would have exercised had the attack been delayed two seconds longer;
      forgotten was the shrewd advice of his owners to have help standing by
      when the ship cleaning should commence. Michael J. Murphy thought of
      nothing but blood, for the fight had started now and he was loath to have
      it cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bloody murderer!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You'd kill me and steal my ship, would
      you?&rdquo; And with the reckless abandon of a sailor he planted the broad toe
      of a number nine boot in Herr von Staden's short ribs, hoping to break a
      few, for in the process of working his way up from the bottom Michael had
      fought under deep-sea rules too often to be squeamish now. So he kicked
      Herr von Staden again, after which a glimmer of reason penetrated his hot
      head and he walked to pick up the supercargo's automatic pistol. Then
      something landed on him from above and he went down backward. His head
      struck the deck with a resounding thump, and Michael J. Murphy had a
      through ticket to the Land of Nod and no stop-over privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The something which had thus inopportunely dropped on Michael was Mr.
      Henckel, the second mate. He had gone up on the bridge to see if the
      canvas jacket had been dropped over the brightly polished brass
      engine-room telegraph apparatus at each end of the bridge, in order to
      protect it from the tropical dew. While thus engaged he had heard the shot
      which von Staden fired at the captain, and forthwith had run across the
      top of the house and peered over to discover what was happening on the
      deck below. Discovering the captain in the act of kicking a distinguished
      son of the Fatherland in that fragile section of the human anatomy
      frequently referred to as the &ldquo;slats,&rdquo; the second mate had stood a moment,
      immobile with horror, the while he gazed upon the fearful scene. Then the
      captain walked to a spot on the deck directly beneath the position
      occupied by his subordinate, and stooped to pick something up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even their enemies are proud of the dash and gallantry, the utter contempt
      for consequences, which animate the German going into battle, and Mr.
      Henckel, second mate of the S.S. <i>Narcissus</i>, was as fine a German as
      one could find in a day's travel. The instant Michael J. Murphy stooped to
      recover von Staden's automatic pistol, therefore, Mr. Henckel saw his duty
      and, in the language of the elect, &ldquo;he went an' done it&rdquo;&mdash;the which
      was absurdly simple. He merely leaped down off the house on top of the
      captain, and forthwith deep peace and profound silence brooded over the
      good ship <i>Narcissus</i>, of San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark here that Mr. Terence Reardon who, had he been
      present, might have had something to say&mdash;not that his action would
      indicate that he despised Mike Murphy the less, but that he loved his
      owners more&mdash;was unfortunately down in the engine-room. Consequently
      he failed to hear the shot, and when he came up on deck the victims of the
      affray had been collected and taken thence, a seaman with a mop had
      removed the profuse evidence which Mike Murphy's rich red blood had
      furnished and Mr. Schultz, the first mate, was on the bridge, while Mr.
      Henckel was up on the forecastle head with his gang, waiting for the order
      to break out the anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a seaman came up on the bridge and reported that the light in
      Mr. Reardon's state-room had been out fifteen minutes. So Mr. Schultz
      waited an hour longer to make certain the chief engineer would be asleep;
      whereupon commenced a harsh, discordant tune&mdash;the music of the anchor
      chain paying in through the hawse pipe. When it ceased Mr. Schultz stepped
      to the marine telegraph; a bell jingled in the bowels of the <i>Narcissus</i>;
      an instant later all the lights aboard her went out as the first assistant
      engineer threw off the switch, and silently in the heavy velvet gloom the
      great vessel slipped out of Pernambuco harbor and headed south.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just about the time the <i>Narcissus</i> was kicking ahead at nine knots,
      in distant San Francisco the cable company was getting Mr. Skinner out of
      bed to dictate to him over the telephone a message which had just arrived
      from Pernambuco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured the incomparable Skinner as he donned a dressing gown and
      slippers and descended to his library to decode the cablegram. &ldquo;The luck
      of the Blue Star flag still holds. That belligerent and highly intelligent
      fellow Murphy has received our cablegram, sent him in care of the American
      consul, and in accordance with my instructions he is acknowledging its
      receipt. Hum-m-m! The first word is 'oriana.' Let me turn to 'oriana.'
      Hum-m! 'I have an order presumably emanating from blank.' Ah, yes, the
      next word is 'Buestar,' the cable address of the Blue Star Navigation
      Company. Well, well, well, the foxy fellow! After wiring us to cable him,
      he gets our cable and then cables us to confirm it! Caution is a virtue,
      but this brand is too high-priced. The next word is 'osculo'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner turned to &ldquo;osculo&rdquo; and discovered that it meant &ldquo;I am ordered
      to&mdash;&rdquo; The next word in the cablegram was &ldquo;Montevideo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Mr. Skinner gasped. &ldquo;He has received orders, presumably
      emanating from us, ordering him to Montevideo! Can it be possible that Mr.
      Ricks or Matt Peasley has sent him a cablegram without my knowledge? I
      must read further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did, and having done so he discovered that, in addition to being
      ordered to Montevideo, Mike Murphy wanted to know if it was all right and
      if von Staden and Ulrich&mdash;presumably German&mdash;were to be trusted;
      that he would remain in command at the company's request, although he
      considered such request unreasonable, even if it could be granted without
      risk. Also, he wanted these instructions confirmed and was anxiously
      awaiting an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm certain of one thing,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner soliloquized after reading
      this extraordinary message: &ldquo;Murphy has not been to the American consul's
      office for the cablegram I sent him several days ago. Evidently there is
      mischief afoot. However, there is nothing to be gained by cabling him
      again in care of the American consul, so I'll just assume that he has
      registered his cable address with the cable company; hence, if I cable him
      to his cable address the message will be delivered to him aboard the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      And since he says he is anxiously awaiting an answer, I'll relieve his
      anxiety with all possible speed and send him an answer immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mr. Skinner wasted several dollars cabling Mike Murphy that the
      Blue Star Navigation had not, to his knowledge, cabled him any
      instructions save those sent in care of the American consul; that von
      Staden and Ulrich were unknown to him, and to be very careful not to lose
      the ship. This message Mr. Skinner dictated over the telephone to the
      telegraph office and asked them to rush it. Evidently they did so, for
      just as Cappy Ricks arrived in the office the following morning, word was
      received from the telegraph company that owing to the departure of the <i>Narcissus</i>
      from Pernambuco the night before, the Blue Star Navigation Company's
      cablegram had not been delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Skinner,&rdquo; Cappy chirped as he sat in at his desk and lighted a
      cigar, &ldquo;what's the news around the shop this fine morning? Any word from
      Murphy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner replied, and laid his information before
      Cappy for perusal. Cappy read it all twice, then slid out to the edge of
      his chair, placed his hands on his knees and looked at Mr. Skinner over
      the rims of his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;this is certainly hell! Cable
      the American consul in Pernambuco and ask him if Murphy received the
      cablegram we sent in care of the consulate. And, in the meantime, don't
      whisper a word of this disquieting information to Matt Peasley. Time
      enough to cross a bridge, Skinner, when you come to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner promptly filed a cablegram to the American consul, and just
      before the office closed they got about forty dollars' worth of reply,
      informing them that Captain Murphy had appeared at the consulate greatly
      excited the night previous; that he had declared the cablegram awaiting
      him might mean life or death&mdash;certainly a large sum of money; that he
      had been given the cablegram and had gone aboard ship to look up his
      cipher key. He had not returned and the ship was not in the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the carbon copy of the cablegram you sent Murphy in care of
      the American consul,&rdquo; Cappy demanded. Mr. Skinner with a sinking heart
      obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; said Cappy, &ldquo;do I understand you sent this message in cipher,
      which necessitated on the part of our captain a trip back to his ship
      before he could decipher it? Why didn't you send him the message in
      regular code? He would then have decoded it right in the consulate, or at
      best he could have gone to the cable office and borrowed a code book from
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent it in our secret cipher,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner faltered. &ldquo;It was delicate
      business&mdash;quite&mdash;er&mdash;an international complication, as it
      were, and in the event of unpleasant developments&mdash;Well, how did I
      know but that some German might be on the key at the cable office when the
      message arrived there for Murphy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Skinner, my boy, quite right,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted sadly. &ldquo;The
      only trouble with you, Skinner, is that you're too danged efficient. You
      look so far into the future you're always gumming up the present.&rdquo; He
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you think&mdash;&rdquo; Skinner began, but Cappy silenced him with
      an autocratic finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think, Skinner, I know. Had it not been for your damnable cipher
      message, Murphy would have got your warning ashore instead of being forced
      to go back to the ship for it. Having got it ashore he would have taken
      care to warn the Brazilian authorities and they would have been on watch
      and prevented the ship from leaving. As I view the situation, Mike went
      aboard, deciphered your message and got ripping mad. Von Staden and Ulrich
      were probably aboard, and hot-headed Mike probably undertook to throw them
      overboard single-handed&mdash;and failed. His body is doubtless feeding
      the fishes in Pernambuco harbor this minute, and our lovely&mdash;big&mdash;<i>Narcissus</i>&mdash;the
      pride of&mdash;the Blue Star fleet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell Captain Peasley?&rdquo; Mr. Skinner faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tell him. He's bound to find out sooner or later. Skinner, I could
      stand the loss of the ship, but what breaks me all up is the thought that
      after forty years of honorable business my friends and my enemies might
      suspect me of being a filibuster. I, Alden P. Ricks, whose
      great-grandfather died at Yorktown, whose grandfather was killed at
      Lundy's Lane, whose father won a medal of honor at Chapultepec&mdash;I,
      Alden P. Ricks, who had to belong to the Home Guard because I was such a
      little runt they wouldn't take me in the Civil War&mdash;to think that I
      should attain to seventy years and even be suspected of staining the flag
      of my country for the sake of a few dirty dollars&mdash;after all the
      Ricks blood that has been shed for that flag! Horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner turned away for, man and boy, he had spent twenty-five years
      under Cappy Ricks, and he loved him. He could not bear to see the old man
      suffer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Michael J. Murphy returned to consciousness he found himself in his
      berth, although for all the effort he made to verify this fact it might
      have been Mr. Reardon's. For fully half an hour he lay there, gradually
      straightening out the tangle in his intellect, and presently he was aware
      that the back of his head was very sore and ached, so he put up his hand
      to rub it and found a lump as large as a walnut. His right shoulder was
      numb and he was unable to move it, although this would not have surprised
      him had he been aware that a hundred and eighty pounds of Teutonic
      masculinity had landed on that shoulder with both feet and dislocated it.
      As it was, the skipper wondered vaguely if the ship's funnel had fallen
      over on him. His right side ached externally, and when he sighed it ached
      internally. That was a broken rib tickling his lung, for, while he was in
      blissful ignorance of the reason therefor, the chronicler of this tale can
      serve no good purpose by concealing the true facts in the case.
      Immediately upon regaining consciousness, Herr August Carl von Staden had
      insisted upon returning Michael J. Murphy's kicks with compound interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy mackerel!&rdquo; the skipper murmured. &ldquo;I feel like I've been fed into a
      concrete mixer. The only injury I can account for is my left shoulder,
      where that supercargo shot me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After spending another half hour in mild speculation on these phenomena he
      was aware of an added impediment in breathing, so he put his hand up to
      his nose and found it clogged with blood. His luxuriant black mustache
      prevented an extended examination of his upper lip, but nevertheless,
      something told him it was split. A hard foreign substance lying between
      his right cheek and the inferior maxillary he concluded must be the pit of
      an olive left over from dinner. Subsequently, however, he discovered it
      was one of his own teeth. So he swore a mighty oath and felt considerably
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly mutiny on the high seas and punishable by hanging,&rdquo; he
      soliloquized. &ldquo;I wonder if Cappy Ricks would know me now;&rdquo; and he reached
      up to turn the switch of the electric light over his berth. He turned the
      switch, but the light did not come on, and while he lay considering this
      state of affairs, he was aware that something that was not his head was
      throbbing in the ship. He decided presently that it was her engines. From
      the steady rhythmic pulsations he realized the vessel was being driven
      full speed ahead; and since he could not recall having given any orders to
      that effect, he was not long in arriving at the correct answer to the
      riddle&mdash;whereupon Michael J. Murphy did what every shipmaster does
      when he loses the ship he loves and finds himself ravished of his
      reputation as a sane and careful skipper. He wept!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who know the breed will bid you beware the Irish when they weep from
      any cause save grief or sympathy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks, who claimed to know Mike Murphy's kind of Irish, doubtless
      would have been extremely gratified had he been granted a peep at the
      battered, bleeding, weeping wreck of his faithful Michael as the pride of
      the Blue Star fleet rolled south to meet the grey sea rovers of the
      Fatherland and deliver the cargo of coal that meant so much to them. The
      sight might have aroused some hope in Cappy's heavy heart, he being by
      nature inconsistent and always seeing a profit where others found naught
      but a deficit. However, though Cappy was variously gifted he was not a
      clairvoyant, in consequence of which he spent a very sleepless night
      following the receipt of that windy cablegram from the American consul. He
      dined at his club, and when it was time for him to leave and his daughter
      sent her car for him, he lacked the courage to go home and face his
      son-in-law. So he spent the night at the club and came down to the office
      about noon, hoping Matt Peasley would have recovered from the shock by
      that time. The latter was waiting for him, and came into Cappy's sanctum
      immediately to hold a post-mortem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Cappy miserably, &ldquo;this is terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we should take the matter up immediately with the State
      Department,&rdquo; Matt replied. &ldquo;There may be a United States warship in those
      waters, and she could be instructed by wireless to endeavor to intercept
      the <i>Narcissus.</i> We can prove a clean bill of health with those
      cablegrams, and get back our ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;from our own Government, of course. But, oh, Matt, if old
      Johnny Bull ever gets his horns into her we can kiss her good-bye. We
      can't bring forward any evidence to alibi that German crew on a ship so
      far off her course and loaded with contraband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know if I were skippering a British warship and picked up the <i>Narcissus,</i>
      her owners would find I was born and bred in Missouri,&rdquo; the honest Matt
      admitted. &ldquo;By the way, have you read this morning's papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Matt. I've felt too blamed miserable about this <i>Narcissus</i>
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, the <i>Gneisenau</i>, the <i>Leipzig,</i>,
      the <i>Dresden</i> and the <i>Nurnberg</i> met a British fleet under
      Admiral Craddock, away down off Coronel, Chile. The British were cleaned
      for fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do tell you. And I'll bet my immortal soul that German fleet is heading
      for the entrance to Magellan this minute. If I were a religious man I'd be
      praying for clear weather so they'll find the entrance without any
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they run ashore and drown every man Jack!&rdquo; cried Cappy fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. You will note that our charterers tried to induce Mike to go to
      Montevideo for orders. That was because they expected to lie snug at
      Montevideo and be within striking distance of a designated meeting place
      in the South Atlantic when the German fleet should pass through Magellan
      from the Pacific. Remember that for several weeks the German fleet has
      managed to lose itself in the Pacific, but now that the British fleet has
      stumbled onto it and forced an engagement, the Australian and Japanese
      cruisers will all be headed for the south coast of Chile to make reprisal.
      We know the Germans are short of coal; doubtless some of the fleet have
      suffered in the engagement with Admiral Craddock's ships, so it's a safe
      bet they'll run into the Atlantic now and raid the Falkland Islands&mdash;by
      the way, a British possession. They will hope to find coal and stores
      there, which, with the cargo of the <i>Narcissus,</i> will enable them to
      continue raiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they will try to accomplish this before England sends a fleet
      to avenge Craddock&mdash;and I'm hoping the Germans will succeed, for, if
      they do, they will surely be decent enough to run our <i>Narcissus</i>
      into some South American port and give us an opportunity to get her back
      again. On the other hand, if the Germans delay their departure from the
      Pacific, the British will surely get wind of the <i>Narcissus</i> waiting
      at Montevideo; and when she comes out they'll just naturally grab her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you're right,&rdquo; Cappy replied gloomily; &ldquo;so for the present we're
      pro-German. Still, I find that a hard dose to swallow, in view of the fact
      that our German crew in the <i>Narcissus</i> has evidently taken the
      vessel away from Mike Murphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they have done just that, sir; otherwise Mike would have obeyed
      our orders. We know he received the orders; hence the only reason he did
      not carry them out was because he wasn't permitted to do so. My only hope
      is that they haven't killed him, for if he is alive and free, he and
      Reardon, with the assistance of the cockney steward and the two Chinese
      cooks, might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might steal her back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt! It isn't possible, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet Mike Murphy and I could steal her back if we had half a chance.
      The odds would be forty to two against our succeeding, but a little
      strategy is sometimes to be preferred to great horsepower. I think I could
      do it, and I think Murphy will do it&mdash;if he only thinks of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Tell me how you'd steal her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use?&rdquo; Matt replied wearily. &ldquo;I'd have to have help. So will
      Mike&mdash;and I've just remembered Mike Murphy and Terence Reardon are
      the wrong kind of Irish to have together in the same ship. We did our best
      to prevent it, but the odds are too long for us; the coal is for the
      Germans and we hate England, so why worry? I know Mike Murphy will not
      take that view of it; for my sake he'll fight to the last gasp, but he
      must have help, and Reardon owes me no such allegiance as Murphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he owes me something,&rdquo; Cappy spoke up. &ldquo;You promised him a hundred
      and seventy-five dollars a month and I raised the ante to two hundred. It
      was an investment, pure and simple. I was buying loyalty, and by the Holy
      Pink-Toed Prophet, I think I'll get it. Come to think of it, there was a
      look in Reardon's eyes that I liked, when he took my hand in those greasy
      paws of his and said he was a proud man to work for me. Matt, that fellow
      is full of bellicose veins. He may not fight for me, but he'll fight for
      Mrs. Reardon and the children and that two-hundred-dollar-a-month job, for
      it's the first he's ever had and if he loses out it'll be the last he'll
      ever get. He was telling me all about his family and how much the job
      meant to him, that day we had the <i>Narcissus</i> out on her trial trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley's face brightened. &ldquo;By Jupiter, that puts a different face on
      the situation. If Reardon is alive they might get together for mutual
      protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cappy piped up, greatly relieved to discover Matt was facing the
      tragedy so optimistically, &ldquo;we might do worse than hope. Wire the State
      Department, Matt; and in the meanwhile, cheer up, sonny, and trust in the
      luck of Alden P. Ricks. I remember Captain Noah Kendall&mdash;peace to his
      ashes&mdash;used to say to me: 'Mr. Ricks, if you ever fell into Channel
      Creek at low tide you'd come up with a pearl necklace wrapped round your
      ankle, and you'd be smelling like a spray of lemon verbena.' Cheer up,
      Matt! What though the cause be lost, the <i>Narcissus</i> is not lost&mdash;yet.
      The Celtic troops remain, and from now on my war cry is going to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ireland uber Alles,&rdquo; Matt Peasley suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're blamed whistlin'!&rdquo; said Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Skinner was called into consultation, and he and Matt Peasley and
      Cappy drew up a heart-rending telegram to the Secretary of State, who
      consulted with the Secretary of the Navy, who wired the Blue Star
      Navigation Company that he was sorry but he didn't have as much as a
      rowboat in the South Atlantic to save their steamer <i>Narcissus,</i> and
      would they please keep still about it, since a noise like that, unless
      absolutely based on facts&mdash;and he understood their wail to be based
      on suspicion&mdash;would tend to create additional friction in an
      international complication already strained to the breaking point.
      Whereupon Cappy Ricks flew into a rage and immediately dictated a long
      letter to his congressman and his senator, urging them to battle to the
      last trench in the campaign for a two-power navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed. Then suddenly the world rocked with the news of the
      annihilation of the German Pacific fleet off the Falkland Islands. Cappy
      Ricks and Matt Peasley read the horrid tale in the morning papers as they
      sat at breakfast, and immediately both lost all interest in food. Like two
      mourners about to set out for the morgue to identify the corpse of a loved
      one recently killed by a taxicab, they drove down to the Blue Star
      offices, where immediately upon arrival something terrible in Mr.
      Skinner's face brought on palpitation of Cappy Ricks' heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he chattered, &ldquo;Have you any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, sir,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Skinner brokenly, &ldquo;but soon! The British
      consul wants you to ring him up. He says he's had a wireless from H.M.S.
      <i>Panther,</i> off the Falkland Islands, and he thinks it will be of
      interest to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my <i>Narcissus</i> confiscated?&rdquo; Cappy and Matt cried in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know,&rdquo; Skinner faltered. &ldquo;I just didn't have the courage
      to pursue the matter further. The British consul said she was captured but
      as for con&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot! Bonehead!&rdquo; rasped Cappy. &ldquo;My <i>Narcissus</i> is gone&mdash;gone!
      Oh, Lord! Matt, you ring up the British consul&mdash;I'm an old man&mdash;Skinner,
      my dear chap, forgive my harsh language. Have you a little drop of whisky
      in the office?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Capt. Michael J. Murphy's futile tears of rage having dried almost as
      quickly as they came, he crawled painfully out of his berth and lighted a
      match, to discover he was a prisoner in his own state-room. He turned
      another electric switch, but still the room remained in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sneaking out of Pernambuco with the lights doused,&rdquo; he soliloquized. Then
      he remembered a little stump of candle he kept in his desk for use when
      heating sealing wax, so he lighted the candle and by its meager rays took
      inventory of his features in the little mirror over his washstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Toe Nails of Moses,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;somebody's sea-boots did
      that, and if I ever find out who was wearing them at the time there'll be
      a fight or a footrace. I'm a total wreck and no insurance&mdash;yes, thank
      God! here's the ship's medicine chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having spent the greater portion of an adventurous career far from medical
      aid in time of bodily stress, Michael J. was, as most shipmasters are,
      rather adept in rough-and-tumble surgery. His compact little library
      contained a common-sense treatise on the care of burns, scalds, cuts,
      fractures and the few minor physical diseases that sailors are heir to,
      and in accordance with immemorial custom he, as master of the ship, was
      the custodian of the medicine chest. So he washed the gore from his face,
      disinfected his split lip and patched himself up after a fashion. The
      bullet wound in his left shoulder proved to be a flesh wound, high up, so
      he cleaned that and decided his left wing would be in fair fighting order
      within a few days. Then he undressed and said his prayers, with a special
      invocation for help from his patron saint, holy Saint Michael, the
      archangel. Evidently Saint Michael inclined a friendly ear, for it is a
      curious fact that no sooner had his namesake risen from his marrow bones
      than a curious sense of peace and comfort stole over him. As in a vision
      he saw Herr August Carl von Staden standing on the bridge, bound at ankle,
      knee and hand and with a rope round his neck. From the supercargo's neck
      the rope led aloft through a small snatch-block fastened to the end of a
      cargo derrick and thence to the drum of the forward winch&mdash;a device
      which had been known to hoist with a jerk objects several tons heavier
      than Herr August Carl von Staden! This picture thus conjured in Murphy's
      imagination was so real he was almost tempted to recite the litany for the
      dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twould have been better for them had they killed me dead and hove my
      carcass overboard,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;The fact that they didn't, but took the
      trouble to carry me to my own bed and lock me in, is proof that they'll
      not murder me now&mdash;so I'll not worry. I'll have every beer-drinking,
      sausage-making son of a seacook begging me for mercy before the week is
      out. I'll just lie low and rest up a bit, and by the time we're off Rio
      I'll drop on them like a top-mast in a typhoon. Then with the help of the
      two Chinamen, the steward and Reardon 'twill not be hard to run her into
      Rio. I wonder if that pirate frisked me of my five thousand.&rdquo; He searched
      through his clothing and was amazed to discover that the bills were still
      in his possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give them back in the morning,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;I had a pistol in the
      drawer of my desk and a rifle in that locker;&rdquo; and in the wild hope that
      his luck still held, he searched eagerly for both. They were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Michael J. Murphy smiled as he wrapped a wet towel round his
      throbbing head, for he had already decided upon his plan of campaign for
      regaining command of his ship, a <i>coup</i> for which he required no
      weapon more formidable than his native intelligence. As he sank groaning
      into the arms of Morpheus, however, even a Digger Indian would have
      realized that for the next two weeks the master of the <i>Narcissus</i>
      would be unable to defend himself against an old lady armed with a
      slipper. Nevertheless, the indomitable fellow, with the amazing optimism
      of his race, had already decided to attack and subdue, within four days,
      thirty-six husky male enemies; which lends some color to the oft-repeated
      declaration that an Irishman fights best when he is on his back with his
      opponent feeling for his windpipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Michael J. Murphy awoke it was broad daylight and Herr August Carl
      von Staden was standing over him. The supercargo was clad in an immaculate
      suit of white flannels and was looking as fresh as new paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo; Murphy queried in amazement. &ldquo;Upon my word, friend
      pirate, I had flattered myself I'd tucked you away for a couple of days at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The excellent Mr. Henckel tells me I was out for ten minutes from that
      solar-plexus blow you landed,&rdquo; Mr. von Staden replied in tones of mingled
      admiration and friendliness. &ldquo;And of course you cannot see how sore my
      ribs feel. I take it rather ill of you to have kicked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kicked you! I wish I'd killed you! And, speaking of kicks, somebody
      certainly kicked me. Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon recovering consciousness,&rdquo; the supercargo replied with some
      embarrassment, &ldquo;I was overcome with fury. You were lying on the floor of
      your stateroom, where Mr. Schultz and Mr. Henckel had hurriedly tossed you&mdash;so
      I came in and kicked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never kicked you in the face,&rdquo; Murphy complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you flattened my nose with your code book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll admit a good smack on the nose does make a man mad. But you
      shot me in the shoulder. By the way, do your lungs hurt when you breathe,
      Dutchy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Do yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slight tickle. I think you caved in my super-structure. Who jumped on
      me from the top of the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dislocated my shoulder. I can wiggle my fingers, so I know it isn't a
      fracture. Suppose you take off your shoe, sit at the foot of my bed, put
      your foot under my right armpit and press, and at the same time pull on my
      right arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, I'm sure,&rdquo; declared Herr von Staden in his charming Oxford
      accent, and forthwith snapped Michael J. Murphy's shoulder into place with
      great dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the skipper answered, and wiped the beads of agony from his
      white face. &ldquo;If you'll frisk my trousers over there on the settee you'll
      find the five thousand dollars you gave me to sell out my owners. I don't
      want it. I never intended to keep it. I was suspicious of you and your
      confounded cablegrams, and I had to have a reasonable excuse to go ashore
      and cable my owners for confirmation. The bribe furnished that excuse. I
      suppose you thought I'd fallen for your game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess your attitude completely deceived me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for the compliment. And now, if you don't mind, suppose you tell
      me something: Was it a German agent who put the bug in my ear about hiring
      the crew of that interned German liner in San Francisco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I greatly fear it was,&rdquo; von Staden answered smilingly. &ldquo;There is an old
      man who presides over the destinies of the Blue Star Navigation Company&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Cappy Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that is the name. He has a reputation for being at once the
      most reckless spendthrift and the most painstaking money saver in the
      world. He is always preaching economy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well I know it. If he hadn't preached it, Captain Peasley would never
      have stood for this rabble your friends wished on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo chuckled. &ldquo;We wanted the largest vessel we could find,&rdquo; he
      explained; &ldquo;and when it was reported to us that the Blue Star Navigation
      Company's <i>Narcissus</i> was going from San Francisco to the West Coast
      and thence to New York with nitrate, we decided to get her. We
      investigated you. Your name is Michael J. Murphy; naturally we knew you
      were Irish; and the Irish&mdash;your kind of Irish&mdash;are not
      sympathetic toward the cause of Merry England. The same held true of your
      chief engineer, Mr. Reardon. We knew of the passion of this interesting
      person, Cappy Ricks, for cutting down expenses. We knew you and Reardon
      were new to your jobs and would be likely to consider any reasonable plan
      for eliminating expense in your respective departments, in the hope of
      pleasing your employer. So the suggestion that you ship our people was
      made to you and Reardon, and you accepted it with alacrity. The rest was
      very easy. We got in touch with your New York agents through some friends
      of ours in very good standing there, and they were enabled to charter the
      ship merely by offering an extraordinary freight rate. They purchased the
      cargo of coal and sold it to us at a nice profit, and we depended on your
      national animosity and racial sympathy, seasoned with a liberal cash
      subsidy, to enable us to deliver it. We preferred to do the decent thing,
      but in the event that you proved unreasonable, we concluded it would be
      wise to have our own people aboard and take the vessel away from you. I
      admit we tried to trick you with the cablegrams. Why attempt to conceal
      the fact now? That was unsportsmanlike. However, if the fat is in the
      fire, as you Americans would say, you have put it there by forcing my
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very cleverly done,&rdquo; quoth Michael J. Murphy. &ldquo;I always admire brains
      wherever I find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men in my line of endeavor are trained to provide for all conceivable
      emergencies, captain. I think I provided for all of them in the case under
      discussion. Who, for instance, would conceive that you would have taken
      the trouble to call upon the American consul for the cipher message that
      has caused all this unpleasant row and facial disfigurement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read the translation, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is self-explanatory. You intend delivering my cargo somewhere off the
      south coast of Uruguay. May I be pardoned for expressing some curiosity as
      to your plans thereafter, my piratical friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not call me your piratical friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're a pirate, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legally&mdash;yes. Morally&mdash;no. In times of national necessity one's
      patriotism&mdash;one's duty to one's country&mdash;excuses, in the minds
      of all fair men, the commission of acts which ordinarily would bring about
      the deepest condemnation. I assure you that if we had had the faintest
      hope of doing business in a businesslike way with your owners, we should
      have been happy to pay almost any price for their ship, for she carries
      ten thousand tons of coal; and you surely must realize, Captain Murphy,
      how limited is the number of ships suitable for our purpose under the
      American flag. We were desperate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Bethmann-Hollweg said something of the same nature with regard
      to Belgium,&rdquo; Murphy replied blandly. &ldquo;A nation fighting for its life is a
      law unto itself, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Self-preservation is the first law of human nature,&rdquo; the supercargo
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Then we understand each other. While I decline to terminate
      the war between August Carl von Staden and Michael Joseph Murphy,
      nevertheless under the law you have just cited I believe I'm entitled to
      breakfast. I'm starved. I figured on having supper ashore last night, but
      after I received that cablegram from my owners I forgot all about food.
      Now I'm remembering. I wish you'd send the steward in with about forty
      dollars' worth of spoon victuals. My grinders are very loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Murphy,&rdquo; his jailer declared, &ldquo;do you know you are a very
      wonderful man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the Murphys are. It runs in the blood, like a wooden leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really regret that you are such a wonderful man. If you were not I'd
      give you the liberty of the ship. As it is, I crave your pardon for
      keeping you a prisoner in your state-room. The exigencies of war, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it, Dutchy. For the second time I ask you: When you have
      delivered this cargo of coal, what do you intend to do with my ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, in all probability, give you a new crew, and the present crew of
      the <i>Narcissus</i> will go aboard one of our warships and thus remove
      themselves from the reach of a possible indictment for piracy and mutiny
      on the high seas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you get a new crew for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our fleet has sunk a few British tramps in mid-ocean during the past
      sixty days. Naturally they removed the crews first. These prisoners are in
      our way, and the admiral will welcome an opportunity to load them all
      aboard the empty <i>Narcissus</i>, for even prisoners of war must eat, and
      the stores aboard our fleet are more valuable than these captured seamen.
      In obedience to that first law of human nature they will not object to
      working the <i>Narcissus</i> into the nearest South American port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's comforting; but for heaven's sake don't be too much of a hog
      with my cargo. Leave me enough of it to carry my ship to the nearest port.
      She burns about thirty-five tons a day&mdash;you might get the statistics
      from Reardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, captain. Our capture of the <i>Narcissus</i> is merely a
      deplorable national necessity. We would not lose her for you for
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about a British cruiser picking her up before we make connections
      with your fleet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Staden shrugged. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;would be the fortune of
      war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would look like the picture of misfortune to me. And how about the
      freight on this cargo you've stolen? Don't my owners get something out of
      this deal to help pay expenses? You're going to play as fair as you can
      with me, aren't you, Dutchy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means. However, you are evidently in doubt as to the real
      situation. Your charterers are responsible to your owners for the freight
      money. If they do not pay it Mr. Cappy Ricks can sue them. As for the
      cargo, we have not stolen it, since one cannot steal that which one owns.
      We paid cash for this cargo before you cleared from Norfolk, for our
      go-between would take no risks whatsoever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Well, I suppose I'll have to grin and bear it. By the way, don't
      forget to take back your blood money. It's in my trousers pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Staden was genuinely distressed. &ldquo;Are you quite certain you want me to
      do that?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Five thousand dollars is quite a sum for a poor sea
      captain to toss aside so contemptuously. Why not accept it as compensation
      for that broken rib, and that bullet I put through your left shoulder, the
      dislocated right shoulder, the loose teeth and the split lip? In fact, I
      am so certain five thousand dollars will not cover your personal injuries
      I am willing to be a sport and add something to the sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy grinned&mdash;rather a horrible grin it was, owing to
      his swollen lip and jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dutchy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;listen to me: All the money in the world couldn't make
      me be untrue to my salt. And if you have any lingering notion that I'm not
      going to collect a million dollars' worth of satisfaction for the way
      you've acted aboard my ship, I can only say that as a fortune-teller
      you'll never earn enough money to keep yourself in cigarettes. You say you
      have been trained to provide for all conceivable emergencies, so I'm
      advising you, as a friend, to brace yourself for the surprise of your life
      before you're a week older. Have you pondered the possibility of sudden
      death aboard the S.S. <i>Narcissus?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Should we be overhauled by a British cruiser I should take a
      short cut to eternity. One naturally dislikes the thought of being hanged
      for a pirate. It would be a reflection on one's family. As for sudden
      death by violence at the hands of any member of the crew of this
      steamship, I should be willing to risk quite a sum of money that no such
      tragedy will be enacted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll be safe in this stateroom until I am ready to turn your
      command back to you, and a man with two shoulders in the condition of
      yours is hardly likely to try battering down this stout state-room door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct. And I'm a trifle too thick in the middle to think of crawling
      through the state-room window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if,&rdquo; the supercargo continued, &ldquo;you have any idea of calling the
      engine-room on that speaking tube and soliciting aid from Mr. Reardon,
      please be advised that for the present Mr. Reardon has been relieved from
      duty in the engine-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've got Reardon locked up, too?&rdquo; Murphy queried. &ldquo;Well! Well! I'd
      hate to think of being locked up and that man Reardon free. However, you
      need not have worried. I'd die before I'd ask that fellow for help&mdash;and
      he'd die before he'd give it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I understand from the first mate. However, I thought it prudent to
      guard against a temporary truce and an alliance for the common interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dutchy,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;you're pretty smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Staden smiled most companionably. &ldquo;I also took the precaution to
      remove some weapons from your apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take anything from me, Dutchy, except my honor, my pipe and tobacco, and
      my ship. Take any one of those four, however, and may the Lord have mercy
      on your soul. Please hand me that book entitled <i>Backwood's Surgery</i>
      till I see what's good for a broken rib; then send the steward for my
      breakfast order. After that&mdash;well, after that you might make your
      will, Dutchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that in Pernambuco,&rdquo; the delightful Herr von Staden replied, &ldquo;so
      your advice is wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed the skipper the book on surgery and went out, carefully locking
      the door behind him. He returned presently and stood beside the steward,
      who thrust his head through the state-room window and desired to know the
      captain's choice of breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bowl of mush and milk, three soft-boiled eggs and a pot of coffee. No
      toast. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the steward returned with the order he was accompanied by Mr.
      Schultz, the first mate. The sight of the traitor threw Mike into a
      furious rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Schultz,&rdquo; he said ominously, &ldquo;the things I'm going to do to you would
      make the devil blush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; Mr. Schultz replied soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to hang von Staden. He's a pirate, and the rule of the Seven
      Seas is that a skipper hangs a pirate whenever he can lay hands on him.
      And you know me, Mr. Schultz. I'm a devil for etiquette aboard ship. As
      for you, you're only guilty of mutiny, so I'll content myself with tricing
      you up to the shrouds and flogging you with a cat soaked in brine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on, <i>ad libitum, ad infinitum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schultz was frankly mystified. Being a German, he did not understand
      the Irish, although in view of the fact that during the war he had room in
      his head for but one thing&mdash;the Fatherland&mdash;perhaps the skipper
      might have pardoned his mate the glance of contempt and utter disgust
      which the latter now bent upon him. Here was a man, Mr. Schultz told
      himself, who, having stipulated his price and struck a bargain, had
      demonstrated beyond cavil that he was not a gentleman, for he had refused
      to stay bought. More, he had basely attacked his benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out, you blackguard, and leave me alone!&rdquo; Murphy yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It iss an order dot I stay und see dot der steward shall mayg no
      conversations vatsoefer,&rdquo; Mr. Schultz declared firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verboten, eh?&rdquo; sneered the skipper. He had once been to Hamburg, and
      naturally he had acquired the word most commonly used in the German
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ja</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Schultz replied placidly, but with an air of finality
      that left no room for further argument.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the course of the afternoon, having chewed the bitter cud of reflection
      and reviewed his situation from every possible angle, Mike Murphy came to
      the conclusion that, for all Terence Reardon's religious backsliding, he
      might be fairly honest in money matters and possessed of a sense of
      loyalty where his owners' interests were concerned. Also, having found
      Herr von Staden bluffing in one instance it occurred to the captain he
      might be discovered bluffing in another&mdash;so he resolved to
      investigate. Accordingly at an hour when he knew Terence should be in the
      engine room he took up the speaking-tube at the head of his bed and blew
      into it. But no shrill whistle signalled his desire in the engine room,
      and though Michael blew until he was red in the face and his lips hurt him
      cruelly, reluctantly he came to the conclusion that Herr August Carl von
      Staden had the situation very well in hand and Terence Reardon in the
      latter's state-room under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right in one particular: von Staden had the situation very well in
      hand, but he did not have Terence Reardon under lock and key. Murphy had
      been balked in making connections with the unsuspecting Terence for the
      reason that a little ball of cotton waste had very carefully been tucked
      into the engine-room howler a few inches at the back of the whistle at the
      chief's end of the tube. Hence, in the event that one sought to whistle up
      the other, he merely wasted his breath. Having learned, on the very
      excellent authority of both men in the case, that they despised each other
      and were not on speaking terms, von Staden decided that the chance of
      Terence Reardon's listening to Michael J. Murphy's tale of piracy and
      mutiny was so vague as to be almost negligible. However, he was
      painstaking and careful in all things and never ran any unnecessary risks;
      consequently, just to be on the safe side, he had instructed the first
      assistant to plug the speaking-tube leading to the skipper's room. And in
      order to discourage the captain from, seeking an interview with the chief,
      von Staden had told the former that the chief was a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon was too important a personage to be deprived of his liberty
      when nothing was to be gained by such action. If he could be kept in
      ignorance of the state of affairs aboard the <i>Narcissus</i>, he would
      continue to attend to business; if the worst came to the worst his
      friendship would be a better asset than his hatred. If he grew suspicious
      and demanded a showdown, Herr von Staden would give it to him without
      reservation and stuff his mouth with gold; then, if the chief declined to
      listen to reason, it would be time enough to lock him up. While the
      supercargo would not hesitate to sacrifice his life, his liberty, or his
      honor for his country, he was nevertheless desirous of being a gentleman
      if accorded the opportuniby. And it must be admitted he had found Mr.
      Reardon amusing and vastly entertaining, for the very first night aboard,
      after Mr. Schultz had introduced him to the chief and he had presented the
      latter with a good cigar, Mr. Reardon, under the spell of the witchery
      cast by the sea and the night, had sat on deck and told the German
      wonderful tales of the fairies in Ireland&mdash;this while the skipper was
      ashore. In particular he told von Staden the tale of the fairy queen with
      the iron hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her hand,&rdquo; said Terence, &ldquo;was as beautiful as ye'd find in a day's
      thravel, an' 'twas herself that'd dhrive men crazy afther wan look at her.
      An' she was good to the poor, but divii a bit av love did she have for a
      redcoat. Whin she'd take human form an' a bowld buck av a British dragoon
      would come making love to her, 'tis herself would say to him: 'Captain,
      alannah, would ye oblige me wit' a dhrink av wather?' An' whin he turrned
      to dhraw the wather, she'd breathe on her hand&mdash;like that&mdash;an'
      immejiately 'twould turn to iron an' wit' wan blow she'd knock his brains
      out. Sure they found the bodies all over Ireland, but divil a man, woman,
      or child could they ever convict av the murrder. For why? Why, sure, the
      minute she'd killed a redcoat she'd breathe on her hand ag'in, an'
      immejiately 'twas flesh an' blood ag'in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, decidedly it would not do to imprison this excellent fellow. Von
      Staden had read fairy tales as a boy, but never had he met a man who could
      tell them like Terence Reardon. A hard-headed, highly intelligent chief
      engineer of a big tramp steamer telling tales of the fairies! Von Staden
      couldn't understand it. It was so childish&mdash;and yet there was nothing
      childish about Terence Reardon. The German wondered if Terence Reardon
      believed in the fairies and finally he asked him point-blank if he did;
      whereupon Terence turned a solemn eye upon him and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, av course I do not. Do you think I'm a blubber-jack av a bhoy? But
      isn't it pleasant to talk about thim whilst wan has nothing betther to do?
      Sure, whin I'm lonely at night I think up new fairy tales to tell to the
      childhren whin I come home from a v'yage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was the Irish of it! Strangely enough it did not occur to the
      practical German that an individual with an imagination like that, on such
      an expedition as the present, was the most dangerous person imaginable to
      be given the freedom of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed twelve days and nights. Mr. Schultz kept in his pocket the key
      to the captain's state-room, and consequently was always present when the
      little cockney steward brought the prisoner his meals, tidied up the
      state-room and made up the captain's bed. The captain spent most of his
      time lying on his uninjured side and remained very quiet, for the
      fractured rib, which had received no attention, was causing him a great
      deal of suffering. Neither did the bullet wound in his shoulder heal
      cleanly, for the reason, unknown to the captain, that the bullet had
      carried with it into the muscle a fragment of Michael J.'s undershirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his physical sufferings were as nothing compared with those he
      experienced mentally. He had hoped to be in fair fighting condition within
      a week at the latest. Wrapped in paper and tucked away in the back of the
      ship's safe he had a silver-hilted stiletto he had taken away from a
      cutthroat who had tried to rob him once in Valparaiso&mdash;and with this
      weapon he had planned to cut away the lock on the state-room door. And
      once outside&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What Michael J. Murphy did not know was that when one has dislocated one's
      shoulder one will do very little wood-carving during the three subsequent
      weeks. It almost broke the skipper's heart to think he had made a threat
      in good faith, and was balked from making it good.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this entire period Mr. Reardon was going about his duties as usual,
      in absolute ignorance of the state of affairs about the ship, for he was
      an innocent, trustful sort of fellow, and to a born romanticist like
      Terence the fairy tale which Mr. Schultz had spun at breakfast the morning
      after leaving Pernambuco was not at all difficult of assimilation. It
      appeared&mdash;according to Mr. Schultz&mdash;that the skipper had gone
      ashore for a night of roystering, and upon returning to the ship about
      midnight, in a wild state of intoxication, had become involved in an
      altercation with the launchman over the fare. In the resultant battle the
      skipper, in his helpless condition, was being terribly beaten by the
      vicious Pernambucan; hence one could scarcely blame him for drawing a
      pistol and shooting the launchman&mdash;fatally, according to Mr. Schultz.
      Of course, after that, to have lingered longer inside the three-mile limit
      would have been sheer insanity, so Mr. Schultz, taking matters into his
      own hands, had uphooked and skipped with doused lights from the
      jurisdiction of the Pernambuco police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did the skipper come out of all this?&rdquo; Mr. Reardon had inquired
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He iss in rodden shape,&rdquo; Mr. Schultz had declared. &ldquo;Von of hiss angles
      vos brogen, und he vos cut mid a knive&mdash;preddy deeb, but noddings to
      worry aboud. Der only drouble iss der dooty of navigading der shib falls
      double on der segond mate und me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him pay ye over-time out av his own wages, the wurthless vagabone!&rdquo;
       Mr. Reardon had urged. &ldquo;May he walk wit' a limp for the rest av his days&mdash;bad
      cess to him! I've a notion, Misther Schultz, that lad'll never comb his
      hair grey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schultz nodded lugubriously; then he glanced up and caught the little
      cockney steward staring at him so balefully, that he realized he must have
      speech in private with the steward. Consequently he lingered at table
      until Mr. Reardon finished his breakfast and went below; whereupon Mr.
      Schultz intimated to the steward, in his direct blunt fashion, that for
      the remainder of the voyage, Riggins&mdash;for that was the steward's name&mdash;was
      to consider himself deaf, dumb and blind; the penalty for reconsideration
      within the hearing of Mr. Reardon being a swift and immediate excursion,
      personally conducted by Mr. Schultz, to Davy Jones's locker! Following
      this earnest exhortation, Riggins, never a robust person mentally or
      physically, came abruptly to the conclusion that this was one of those
      occasions where silence, if not exactly golden, was at least to be
      preferred to great riches.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT may appear strange that during the days and nights Michael J. Murphy
      lay on his bed of pain Terence Reardon did not once pass the little open
      window of the skipper's state-room. Not, however, that the latter watched
      for him, for he did not. He believed that Reardon, like himself, was a
      prisoner; although, had the chief passed the window and had the captain
      observed his passing, the complacence of Herr von Staden and his patriotic
      company would have received a jar much earlier in the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, however, for Murphy's plans, the chief's stateroom was
      located in the after part of the house and on the side opposite the
      skipper's, and following their brief spat through the speaking-tube,
      Terence Reardon had confined himself exclusively to his engine-room and
      that portion of the ship along which he must of necessity pass when going
      to and from his state-room. He told himself it was the part of wisdom for
      one of his ferocious temper to avoid the occasions of sin. Certainly it
      would be hard to pass the skipper's state-room without looking in,
      particularly since in these warm latitudes the door would probably be
      open; for should the skipper be within at the time, they would
      peradventure scowl at each other, and he is a fool indeed who cannot
      foretell the future when a thousand generations of natural enemies
      exchange &ldquo;the black look.&rdquo; Terence remembered his boy Johnny, a youth who,
      according to Mrs. Reardon, should never be a marine engineer, but the
      finest lawyer that ever pouched a fat fee. And there was Mary Agnes and
      Catherine Bertram. Next year they would begin taking piano lessons, and in
      the fullness of time, no matter how hard the pull, both should go to the
      state university and acquire the education made to fit their father's
      head, but by force of circumstances denied him. And at the thought Terence
      looked at his hard black hands and set himself resolutely to face a life
      sentence of rattling ash hoists, roaring furnaces and the soft sucking
      sounds of the pistons. Two hundred dollars a month&mdash;and the union
      scale was a hundred and fifty! Ah, no, he dared not trifle with that job.
      He must, at all hazard, avoid friction with the skipper, for what would
      Mrs. Reardon say if Cappy Ricks forced him to roll the bones with Mike
      Murphy&mdash;one flop and high man out? Mr. Reardon could close his eyes
      and see Mike Murphy roll out a &ldquo;stiff,&rdquo; while with trembling hand the
      Reardon rolled five sixes!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Narcissus</i> had been out of Pernambuco harbor four days before
      Mr. Reardon, upon comparing the sun&mdash;which all are agreed rises in
      the east&mdash;with the direction in which the ship was headed, and then
      extracting the cube root of the resultant product, and subtracting it from
      the longtitude and latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, decided that there
      must be something wrong with Mr. Schultz's navigation. So he spoke to Mr.
      Schultz about it, and was laughingly informed that they were traveling on
      a great circle. Thereupon Mr. Reardon remembered that at sea a ship
      traveling on the arc of a great circle, for some mysterious reason
      repudiates the old geometrical theorem that a straight line is the
      shortest distance between two points. He recalled that vessels plying
      between San Francisco and Yokohama describe a great circle which brings
      them well up toward the Aleutian Islands, So he was satisfied with the
      explanation, this being his first voyage into the South Atlantic anyhow;
      but he continued to observe the sun each morning, and still the vessel's
      head held far to the south. A suspicion that all was not as it should be
      slowly settled in Mr. Reardon's head, and though he said nothing, he used
      his ejes and ears. A dozen times a day, as the ship rolled steadily south,
      he was tempted to take down the speaking tube and confide his suspicions
      to the master, confined in his state-room by reason of deep&mdash;but not
      serious-knife wounds. Each time he was on the point of yielding, however,
      he remembered that Mike Murphy had called him a renegade&mdash;so he
      refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The installation of the wireless plant and the presence aboard the ship of
      Herr von Staden had failed to arouse his suspicions the first day out.
      True, the wireless could not have been connected with the electric light
      plant below without Mr. Reardon's knowledge and consent, but when he asked
      Mr. Schultz about it the latter replied that Cappy Ricks must have changed
      his mind about installing wireless on the <i>Narcissus</i>, for he had
      cabled to the agents of the charterers in Pernambuco to have a wireless
      plant and a competent operator waiting for the vessel upon arrival. It was
      Mr. Schultz's opinion that the owners had evidently arrived at the
      conclusion that it was wise to have a wireless aboard during war times.
      Personally, Mr. Schultz approved of the innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did Terence Reardon, for that matter. He found the new wireless
      operator a charming fellow, possessed of talents far superior to those of
      the young men who ordinarily pound the brass at sea. Indeed, after the
      second day out, Mr. Reardon would have been heartbroken had anything
      happened to that wireless. For Herr August Carl von Staden sat at the key
      almost continuously, eavesdropping on the war news, and Mr. Reardon never
      came to the wireless room that the operator did not have some news of an
      overwhelming British defeat!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the voyage proceeded, however, and Mr. Reardon's mind grew a trifle
      uneasy, reluctantly he began to view Herr von Staden and the wireless with
      apprehension. He asked the affable operator how much the Marconi company
      charged the <i>Narcissus</i> for his services and the rental of the
      wireless plant, and von Staden, momentarily stumped, replied that the
      tariff was two hundred dollars a month; whereupon Reardon knew he lied,
      for the charge is one hundred and forty. The German, realizing instantly
      that he was not on the target, added: &ldquo;That is, for a first-grade operator
      and a plant like this. Of course we furnish cheaper operators and less
      powerful plants, Mr. Reardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So that's the way av it?&rdquo; the chief replied, and immediately went to
      his state-room for the purpose of thinking it over. Eventually he came to
      the conclusion that all was not as it should be, but that, nevertheless,
      it was no affair of his. He was paid to obey signals given him from the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis no business av mine, afther all,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;For why should I
      be puttin' dogs in windows? He's paid to navigate the ship, an' didn't
      Cappy Ricks tell me to mind me own business? And yet, there's something
      wrong in this ship. I feel it in me bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt it with a force that was almost violent when Mr. Schultz called
      down through the speaking-tube late one afternoon and told him to put her
      under a dead-slow bell. That meant they were practically heaving to, and
      steamers only heave to at sea in fine weather when they have reached a
      certain longitude and latitude and plan to keep an appointment. On the
      instant there was a strong odor of rat in Terence Reardon's engine room,
      but his &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; contained no hint of his surprise and suspicion.
      He gave his orders to the firemen to bank the fires, and when this had
      been done he informed his engine-room crew that they might all go on deck
      for five minutes and get a breath of fresh air. Nothing loath, they
      scrambled up the steel stairway&mdash;and the instant the last man was out
      of earshot Terence Reardon sprang to the speaking-tube to whistle up the
      skipper in his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, undoubtedly the cool and calculating Herr August Carl von Staden had
      been carefully trained to take into consideration, when planning his
      strategy, every conceivable contingency that might possibly arise. It is
      probable that the German secret service never turned out a more finished
      graduate than Herr von Staden; but the fact remains, nevertheless, that
      there are certain contingencies over which no human being has control. One
      of these is Newton's law of gravitation; another, an equally immutable law
      to the effect that water will seek its own level; a third, the
      vindictiveness of an outraged Irishman; and a fourth, the very natural
      tendency of any man, not excepting Mr. Terence Reardon, to be profoundly
      surprised and intensely curious when certain phenomena, which we shall now
      proceed to explain, take place in the engine room where he is chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy, having only the day before again essayed the task of
      whistling up the engine room, and having, by reason of the ball of cotton
      waste with which the tube had been plugged by the first assistant
      engineer, again failed to receive the courtesy of a reply from any one,
      had, to put it mildly, been annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my bullies,&rdquo; he soliloquized as he hung up the tube, &ldquo;you
      wouldn't speak to me when I wanted to speak to you; so now the first time
      one of you wants to speak to me I'll hand you a surprise, and I'll hand it
      to you right in the mouth.&rdquo; And forthwith Michael J. had carefully poured
      down the speaking tube the contents of the basin in which he had just made
      his morning ablutions! He longed to do something nasty, and he succeeded
      admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have already remarked, water seeks its own level. It ran down the
      speaking-tube until it encountered the cotton waste plug; whereupon, due
      to the hydrostatic pressure, the plug gave way and was forced down to the
      tightly closed mouth of the tube, and the suds backed up behind it. It was
      pretty warm in the engine room, and most of the water had evaporated by
      the time Terence Reardon took down the looped tube and opened it for the
      purpose of putting his lips to the mouthpiece and blowing heartily through
      it. However, there was about a gill of water left in the tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as everybody knows, water running down a slope of seventy-five or
      eighty degrees comes rather fast. Consequently Mr. Reardon had no time to
      dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why be squeamish? He got a mouthful and was very nauseated for half a
      minute. Also he cursed, we regret to record, and was very, very angry.
      Carefully he drained the devilish tube, wiped it clean with some fresh
      waste, and racked his brain for the right thing to say to Michael J.
      Murphy. Finally he hit upon something he concluded would about fill the
      bill, so he put his lips to the mouthpiece once more and whistled up the
      skipper. To his surprise, however, his breath didn't seem to get anywhere:
      in fact, it was directed back in his face rather forcefully; so he
      investigated and discovered the mouthpiece was only half open. Upon
      endeavoring to open it fully he sensed an obstruction in the back of it,
      so he unscrewed the mouthpiece and drew forth a ball of dirty,
      sour-smelling cotton waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed a moment in speechless wonder. Then: &ldquo;I'll whistle that dirrty
      Tomfool, until he answers me in self-defense,&rdquo; he announced'to the main
      motor, and forthwith blew a mighty blast. Almost instantly Michael J.
      Murphy yelled: &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murphy,&rdquo; Terence Reardon announced calmly and very distinctly, &ldquo;you're a
      contimptible dhrunken ape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Moses! Reardon, is that you?&rdquo; the astounded Murphy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is-as you'll discover whin you're able to come on deck an' give me the
      satisfaction I'll demand for the dirrty dab av wather an' cotton waste you
      put in the tube, knowin' that the firrst time I took it down to spheak to
      you, ye blackguard, in the line av djooty&mdash;which is the only reason I
      would spheak to you&mdash;I'd get it full in the mouth. Ye dirrty, lyin',
      schamin', dhrunken murrderer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to let that stream of adjectival opprobrium sink in. Silence.
      Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I poured the contents of my washbasin in the tube, I'll admit, but I did
      not plug it with cotton waste. One of your assistants did that, chief, and
      as for the water, as God is my judge, I didn't intend it for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else would ye be afther insultin' if it wasn't me? Are ye not
      friendly wit' me assistants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Reardon, and listen to what I'm going to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the tale was told. When it was done Terence Reardon grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew it! I felt in me bones there was something
      wrong aboard this ship. An' so ye were not dhrunk an' disordherly at
      Pernambuco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The liars! Did they tell you that? Reardon, it's only the mercy of heaven
      they didn't murder me. I'm lying here, helpless and crippled in my
      state-room, with the key turned in the lock. They've stolen my ship from
      me, and I can tell by the roll of her she's practically hove to under a
      dead-slow bell this minute. We've reached the rendezvous&mdash;we're
      waiting for the German fleet to deliver the coal; and oh, man, man, if
      we're caught by a British cruiser we'll lose the ship! They'll confiscate
      her, chief. Wirra! Wirra!&rdquo; he cried, breaking into the forgotten wail of
      his childhood. &ldquo;How can I ever face Matt Peasley and Cappy Ricks after
      this? Reardon, man, they'll think we stood in with the Germans and let
      them do it. We're both Irish&mdash;they know we're both pro-German&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you said?&rdquo; Terence demanded sharply. &ldquo;Me pro-German. Me? I <i>was</i>
      pro-German&mdash;yis&mdash;wanst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fell a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the benefit of the uninitiated, be it known that there is a
      certain curse employed by the Irish and by no other race on earth.
      Whenever you hear an Irishman employ it, you know instantly&mdash;provided,
      of course, you are Irish yourself&mdash;just what kind of Irish that
      Irishman is. You cannot mistake it. There is no possible chance. It is
      only brought forth with the dust of the centuries on it, so to speak, to
      grace a fitting occasion. Terence Reardon felt that such an occasion was
      now at hand. As naturally, as inevitably, therefore, as the suds ran down
      the speaking-tube, that curse climbed up it&mdash;softly, distinctly, and
      with a wealth of feeling in the back of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God put the curse av Crummle on thim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon, of course, referred to the late Oliver Cromwell. Any one who
      has ever read the sorry history of Erin knows what the amiable Oliver did
      to the Irish. Consequently such an one will have no difficulty in
      estimating the precise proportions of bad luck Terence Reardon prayed
      might be the immediate heritage of the crew of the S.S. <i>Narcissus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy blinked rapidly, for all the world as if Mr. Schultz had
      entered at that moment and struck him a terrific blow on top of the head.
      A more dazed Irishman than he never threw an ancient egg or a defunct cat
      at an alleged Celtic comedian with green whiskers. He was absolutely
      staggered&mdash;but not for long. The Irish come back very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you, Terence Reardon!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;And you with a Masonic ring
      on your finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; cried the delighted Terence. &ldquo;Sure are you wan av us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of you!&rdquo; Mike Murphy fairly shrieked. &ldquo;The minute I'm out of this
      room you'll apologize or fight for thinking I'm a renegade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Naboclish!</i>&rdquo; laughed Terence Reardon, slipping into the Gaelic and
      out again. &ldquo;The divil a Mason am I! Sure that ring ye saw on me finger
      that day in the office av the owners belonged to me second assistant in
      the <i>Arab</i>. He'd lost it in the engine room, an' a mont' afther he'd
      left I found it. Not knowin' what ship he was in, 'twas me intintion to
      take the ring over to the Marine Engineers' Association an' lave it for
      him wit' the secreth'ry; and to make sure I wouldn't forget it I put it on
      me finger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you knew, Terence, that with the likes of me round you'd not be
      liable to forget it,&rdquo; Mike Murphy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, ye divil,&rdquo; Terence continued, &ldquo;faith, what wit' yer English
      tweeds an' the fancy cut av thim, an' yer lack av the brogue an' the broad
      <i>a</i> av ye, I thought, begorra, ye were a dirrty Far Down! God love
      ye, Michael, but 'tis the likes av you I'm proud to be ship-mates wit'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you were from Belfast, Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am. I was borrn there, but me parents&mdash;the Lord 'a' merrcy on
      their sowls&mdash;moved back to Kerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Michael, me poor lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever drink on duty? I don't mean with your superiors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief chuckled. He knew what Murphy was alluding to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;wit' me equals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a pity, Terence, that man Schultz has the key to my state-room in
      his pocket. Now if you could manage to tap that Dutchman on the head with
      something hard and heavy, take the key out of his pocket and throw him
      overheard, you could let me out of this purgatory I'm in. Then I wouldn't
      be surprised if the sight of me and the absence of Mr. Schultz would put a
      bit of heart in that little cockney steward&mdash;and maybe he'd bring a
      drink to hearten you for what's ahead of you this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' what might that be, avic?&rdquo; Terence demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to steal the ship back from them, Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Michael. 'Tis not a small thing ye ask me to do, but the divil
      a more willin' man could ye find to ask. Have ye figured out the plan av
      campaign? Sure what wit' the suddenness av it all I'm all in a shweat wit'
      excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be cold enough before morning, Terry, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck to you, Michael! Dyin' is wan thing I cannot afford to do,
      although be the same token they tell me ould Ricks has a kind shpot in the
      heart av him for the widow an' the orphan&mdash;particularly av thim that
      dies in his service! As I say, I cannot afford to get kilt, but in back av
      that ag'in I cannot afford to lose the best job I ever had. An' afther
      all, 'tis a poor man that won't fight for a fine, kind gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the fine, kind gentleman! It serves him right for letting us get
      into this fix. He can afford the loss of the ship, but you and I, Terence
      Reardon, cannot afford the loss of our honor and self-respect. For the
      sake of the blood that's in us we can't afford to let a lot of Dutchmen
      steal our ship and cargo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; Reardon warned. &ldquo;Hurry up. Me crew is comin' below ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it a point to pass by my state-room window after dark. You'll find a
      scrap of paper on the sill. Help yourself to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I will,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon promised fervently, and the tube closed with
      a click.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      TERENCE Reardon's preparations for the night's work began the instant he
      hung up the speaking-tube. The <i>Narcissus</i> carried three assistant
      engineers, in consequence of which Mr. Reardon was not required to stand a
      watch unless he so elected; although from force of habit acquired in the
      days when he had been chief of the <i>Arab</i>&mdash;a little
      three-thousand-ton tramp&mdash;and perforce had to stand a regular watch,
      he found it very difficult not to spend at least eight hours in every
      twenty-four in the engine room. When, eventually, he came to a realization
      that his job was not to make the engines behave, but to see that they
      behaved properly, he spent more of his time on deck, and put in only a few
      hours below during the watch of the third assistant engineer&mdash;the
      third assistant being a young man in whom the chief reposed exactly that
      degree of confidence a chief engineer should always repose in a third
      assistant. Mr. Reardon, therefore, was at liberty to leave the engine-room
      whenever he felt so disposed; and following his illuminating conversation
      with the captain he felt very much disposed to leave immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went first to his state-room, where he bathed, changed into new
      under-clothes and socks, donned a freshly laundered suit of faded
      dungarees&mdash;old, faded, well-washed dungarees, by the way, always
      appearing neater and cleaner than new ones&mdash;and shaved; for if
      Providence willed it that lie should die to-night. Mr. Reardon was
      resolved to be in such a highly sanitary condition that &ldquo;those upon whom
      should devolve the melancholy duty of laying him out&rdquo;&mdash;which phrase,
      in the Hibernian sense, means those who should dispose his limbs, close
      his eyes, tie up his black jowls with a towel and fold his hands&mdash;alas,
      so white in death, at last! across his still breast&mdash;might be moved
      to remark that, notwithstanding the nature of the deceased's vocation,
      they could not recall ever having seen a cleaner corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having attended to his pre-dissolution toilet, Mr. Reardon next sat in at
      his littered desk, swept a space clear of tobacco crumbs, ashes, pipes and
      some old copies of the <i>Cork Eagle</i>, and sat down to write a farewell
      letter to his wife, hoping that, even though his enemies should slay him,
      yet would they have sufficient respect for the dead to mail that letter to
      Mrs. Reardon. And, in order that he might not anger his posthumous
      benefactors, he mentioned nothing of the state of affairs aboard the ship.
      He merely stated that she might never see him again, in which event she
      was to call upon the owners and ask them to invest for her the proceeds of
      his life insurance policy, since they could and would invest it to better
      advantage than she. Then he spoke of his grief at the thought of the
      children being forced to forego their college education and suggested that
      she ask Cappy Ricks to give Johnny a place in his office; also, should the
      owners offer anything as compensation for the loss of her husband, she was
      to accept it, for, as God was his judge, she would be entitled to it! This
      last sentence Terence underscored for emphasis; that was as close as he
      came to saying that if he died it would be in defense of his owner's
      interest. Then he commended her to the comfort of her religion and
      subscribed himself: &ldquo;Your loving and devoted husband, Terence P. Reardon,
      Chief Engineer S.S. <i>Narcissus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having set his small affairs in order against a hasty exit from this vale
      of hatreds, Mr. Reardon, in unconscious imitation of all the condemned men
      who had preceded him on the voyage across the Styx, repaired to the dining
      saloon and partook of a hearty meal. He realized he had undertaken a
      contract that would require the employment of weapons more formidable than
      his hard fists, and devoutly he wished that, like the fairy queen, he had
      but to breathe on them to metamorphose them into pig iron. He pictured the
      slaughter aboard the <i>Narcissus</i> when he should wade into the
      conflict. Finally he made up his mind that, in lieu of an iron hand or
      two, he would use his favorite monkey wrench, for he had no firearms
      whatsoever; although, had somebody presented him with a one-man machine
      gun with full directions for using, Mr Reardon would have recoiled in
      horror from it. Firearms were highly dangerous. They killed so many
      people!
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the table long before the others had finished. There was no one on
      deck as he emerged from the dining saloon, so he walked leisurely round
      past the captain's cabin, whistling the &ldquo;Cruiskeen Lawn&rdquo; to let Mike
      Murphy know who was coming. Evidently Michael assimilated the hint, for
      there was an envelope on the little window sill as Terence hove abreast of
      it. He snatched it swiftly away and continued round to his own state-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope contained Michael J. Murphy's plan for campaign worked out to
      the most minute detail, by reason of his absolute knowledge of the customs
      aboard the ship. Mr. Reardon read the remarkable document and sat lost in
      admiration; a twinkle leaped to his eyes and a cunning, rather deadly
      little smile came sneaking round the corners of his broad chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, but 'tis a beautiful schame,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;Who but that lad
      could have t'ought av it? An' here I've been shpendin' the past two hours
      borrowin' trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read and reread the plan of attack, in order to familiarize himself
      with the details; then he held a match to the document and destroyed it.
      He considered a moment, and then performed a similar service to his
      farewell letter to Mrs. Reardon, for the chief engineer of the S.S. <i>Narcissus</i>,
      of San Francisco, had made up his mind not to die&mdash;to-night!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Schultz, the first assistant, and Mr. von Staden were engaged in
      coffee and repartee when Terence Reardon thrust his head in at the dining
      saloon window. He was mildly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the Great Gun av Athlone!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I've just been bit be a
      bedbug&mdash;an' I t'ought there wasn't a bedbug in the ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schultz looked up, horrified. &ldquo;Chieve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dot is rodden news.
      Bedbugs! <i>Ach!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' well you may '<i>Ach</i>,' Misther Schultz. Let a colony av bedbugs
      move into the <i>Narcissus</i> an' Terence P. Reardon will move out.
      There's only wan thing to do, Misther Schultz, an' that is to tackle the
      divils before we're overwhelmed be the weight av numbers. Have ye a bit av
      sulphur in yer shtore-room, Misther Schultz&mdash;the kind that comes in
      balls an' is used to burrn in shtate-rooms to kill bedbugs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Terence Reardon put that innocent query to the first mate he knew
      very well Mr. Schultz would reply in the negative&mdash;which he did&mdash;for
      the reason that Michael J. Murphy had privately informed Mr. Reardon that
      the little cockney steward, Riggins, had charge of the bedbug ammunition.
      Riggins, who had been standing with his back against the wall, eyeing Mr.
      Schultz sourly, now spoke up and said he had some sulphur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More power to ye, Riggins!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon declared heartily. &ldquo;Then do ye,
      like the good lad, give me two or three balls av it. I'll burn them in me
      shtate-room to-night, wit' the door an' window locked, an' be morrnin'
      sorra bedbug will be left alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; Riggins replied. &ldquo;Might Hi arsk, Mr. Reardon, where you
      hintend passin' the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll shleep in me auld aisy-chair abaft the house an' next the funnel,
      where I'll be snug an' warrm,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon replied, for he desired an
      excuse to be on deck all night without arousing the suspicions of Mr.
      Schultz or von Staden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward, having finished serving those who ate in the dining saloon,
      stepped out on deck and started for his own room. Mr. Reardon remained by
      the window a minute, discoursing on the curse of bedbugs aboard a ship,
      and then with a sigh followed the steward leisurely. Mr. Schultz appeared
      undecided whether or not to accompany him in the capacity of censor, but
      finally concluded to remain and finish his coffee, for if Riggins had
      decided to enlighten the chief as to the real reason for the skipper's
      indisposition he had had frequent opportunity to do so during the past ten
      days. It did not seem likely, therefore, that he would run any risks at
      this late date. To Mr. Schultz, Riggins appeared to be a man who could be
      depended upon to remember which side his bread was buttered on and who
      supplied the butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the steward's state-room, Mr. Reardon helped himself to the
      entire box of bedbug exterminator and addressed Riggins very briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riggins, ye're a child av Johnny Bull, are ye not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Riggins, without the slightest trace of embarrassment, admitted his
      disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' bein' what ye are,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon continued, &ldquo;would ye do somethin' av
      great binifit to England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Riggins replied that inasmuch as he had lost two brothers at the Battle of
      the Marne, that ought to indicate bally well where the Riggins tribe stood
      on the subject of defense of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon murmured. &ldquo;Even if misguided in their pathriotic
      motives, shtill yer brothers were brave min, an' for that I respect thim.
      Now, thin, Riggins, ye rabbit, listen to me: In a momint av surpassin'
      innocince Captain Murphy an' mesilf swallowed a cute suggestion from a lad
      whose back I'll break in two halves whin the <i>Narcissus</i> gets back to
      San Francisco. 'Why not save expinse,' says he, 'an' ship the crew av this
      German liner that's interned over in Richardson's Bay?' Riggins, to make a
      long shtory short, we have thim this minute, an' the dear God knows that
      even if shipped at the German scale av wages that gang'll prove a dear
      crew to the Blue Star Navigation Company if you an' I, Riggins, fail to do
      our djooty. They've half murdered the captain, shtolen the ship an' cargo
      from him, an' run her t'ousands av miles off her course to deliver the
      coal to the German fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my bloody ol' Aunt Maria!&rdquo; gasped the horrified Riggins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to know from you, Riggins, is this: Will ye help me shteal
      the ship back to-night? We're runnin' almost due south, an' that
      good-for-nothin' von Staden has been in communication wit' the fleet all
      day long. I feel it in me bones. If we get the ship back we'll head due
      west for the coast av South America an' hug the three-mile limit-an' the
      devil scoort them thin. Riggins, ye gossoon, what for the cause av Merry
      England? They wouldn't take ye for a gift in the British Arrmy, for I
      doubt if ye'd weigh ninety pounds soakin' wet an' a rock in yer hand, but
      for all that, here's an iligant opporchunity for ye to serrve yer
      counthry, an' should worrd av yer brave action reach the king&mdash;bad
      cess to him&mdash;he may call ye Sir Thomas Riggins an' make ye
      consul-general av the Cannibal Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out wit' it, Riggins. Yer king an' counthry calls ye, an' be the same
      token so do Michael J. Murphy an' Terence P. Reardon. What'll ye give,
      Riggins, to preserve the seas to Britain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me 'eart's blood, that's wot!&rdquo; Riggins replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the sacrifice in the name av His Majesty, King Jarge! Be on deck
      at ten o'clock sharp, waitin' close undher the shtarboard companion
      leadin' to the bridge. Whin I come out on the shtarboard ind av the bridge
      an' whistle 'O'Donnell Abu,' do ye&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'help me, chief, I never 'eard of the blighter before,&rdquo; Riggins
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon murmured <i>sotto voce</i>. &ldquo;I'll have to do
      it. Well, thin, Riggins, whin I come out on the shtarboard ind av the
      bridge an' whistle 'God Save the King'&mdash;troth, I'll gamble that's one
      blighter ye've hearrd tell av&mdash;do ye run up into the pilot-house an'
      take the wheel. I'll not whistle until we have the deck to ourselves,
      wit'out fear av intherruption, an' ye must come quick an' take the wheel,
      else the vessel'll fall off into the trough av the sea an' commince to
      wallow&mdash;which same'll wake up the second mate an' bring him an' von
      Staden on deck to see what's wrong wit' her. An' until I'm ready to call
      on those lads I'm not wishful to have them call on me! Remimber, Riggins:
      Wan jump an' ye're into the pilot-house; then howld her head up to the sea&mdash;an'
      lave the rest to me. Gwan wit' ye now, or that skut, Schultz, will be
      gettin' suspicious av us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Schultz came along ten minutes later he found Mr. Reardon very
      busy calking with oakum the cracks round the door and window of his
      state-room, through which little wisps of yellow smoke were curling. Mr.
      Schultz was so completely deceived that he hurried round to his own
      quarters and pawed over his own mattress and bedding in a vain search for
      bedbugs.

      At eight o'clock Mr. Schultz relieved the second mate on the bridge, and
      five minutes later Terence Reardon, for the first time invaded that
      forbidden territory. &ldquo;Bad cess to me!&rdquo; he complained plaintively. &ldquo;I'm the
      picthur av bad luck. I've a leaky connection below an' divil a bit av red
      lead. Could ye lind me a dab av red lead from yer shtore-room, Misther
      Schultz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schultz marvelled that any man could force his mind to dwell on red
      lead, leaky pipe connections, sulphur and bedbugs in a ship like the <i>Narcissus</i>
      at a time like this. He had met a few innocents in his day, but this Irish
      engineer was most innocent of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Mike!&rdquo; he replied, and grinned at his feeble play on words. &ldquo;<i>Und</i>
      as I gannot leave der bridge yet, here iss der key to der store-room. Helb
      yourself, mine <i>Freund, und</i> den gif me der key back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye addie-pated son of sin!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon soliloquized as he took the key
      and departed. &ldquo;Faith, a booby birrd has more sinse nor you! D'ye suppose I
      didn't wait until ye were on djooty before axin' ye, well knowin' ye'd
      lind me the key an' I'd be alone in yer shtore-room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon was in the store-room less than two minutes. When he emerged
      he carried a daub of red lead on an old spoon, as Mr. Schultz, looking
      down on the dimly lighted main deck, observed. What he did not observe,
      however, was the chief's action in tossing the spoon overboard the instant
      he passed beyond the range of Mr. Schultz's vision. It is probable, also,
      that the mate would have been disturbed could he have seen Mr. Reardon in
      his state-room, with the door locked, removing from beneath his dungaree
      jumper several fathoms of light, strong, cotton signal halyard, two
      five-foot lengths of half-inch steel chain, and a strip of canvas. His
      pockets also gave up two padlocks, with keys to fit. This loot Mr. Reardon
      very carefully hid in the space under his settee, after which, with due
      thanks, he returned the key to Mr. Schultz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the evening until nine-thirty Terence spent in the
      wireless room with Herr von Staden. Then he retired, very low in spirits,
      to his state-room, to make his preparations for wholesale assault with a
      deadly weapon&mdash;possibly wholesale murder! He cut the signal halyard
      into short lengths; then he cut the piece of canvas into strips about two
      inches wide and secreted the halyard and canvas strips here and there
      about his person. Then he descended to the engine room and selected his
      monkey wrench from the tool rack on the wall, helped himself to a handful
      of cotton waste, and returned to his state-room mournfully keening &ldquo;The
      Sorrowful Lamentation of Callaghan, Greally and Mullen, killed at the Fair
      of Turloughmore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wirra,&rdquo; he murmured presently, &ldquo;but 'tis a terrible thing to hit an
      unsuspectin' man wit' a monkey wrench! An' that divil von Staden, for all
      his faults, is not a bad lad at all at all. An' I'd give five dollars&mdash;yes,
      seven an' a half&mdash;if he were bald an' shiny on any other shpot save
      an' exceptin' the shpot I have to hit him. Ochone!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'Come tell me, dearest mother, what makes me father shtay
    Or what can be th' reason that he's so long away?'
   'Oh, howld yer tongue, me darlin' son, yer tears do grieve me sore,
    I fear he has been murdhered in the fair av Turloughmore!'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I haven't got the heart to dhrive the head av this monkey wrench
      into that bald shpot. If he'd hair there I wouldn't mind.&rdquo; Mr. Reardon
      sighed dismally. &ldquo;I'll have to wrap a waddin' av waste around me weapon,
      so I'll neither kill nor mangle but lay thim out wit' wan good crack&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'It is on the firrst av August, the truth I will declare,
    Those people they assimbled that day all at the fair,
    But little was their notion that evil was in shtore,
    All by the bloody Peelers at the fair av Turloughmore.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must practice crackin' the divils! Sure, 'twould be an awful thing to
      have the sin av murrder on me sowl&mdash;not that 'tis murrder to kill a
      Dutchman that's a self-confessed pirate into the bargain. Shtill, 'tis a
      terrible t'ought to carry to the grave&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wham! Mr. Reardon brought his padded wrench down on his defenseless bed.
      &ldquo;Too harrd,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Sure a blow like that on top av the head
      would knock out the teeth av the divil himself! Less horse-power,
      Terence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wham! He tried it again, this time with better results. For five minutes
      he beat the bedclothes; then his spirits rose and, like the mercurial Celt
      that he was, he chanted blithely a verse from &ldquo;The Night Before Larry Was
      Stretched&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'Though, sure 'tis the best way to die,
        Oh, the divil a betther a-livin'!
    For sure whin the gallows is high,
        Your journey is shorter to heaven;
    But what harasses Larry the most,
        An' makes his poor sowl melancholy,
    Is to think av the time whin his ghost
        Will come in a sheet to sweet Molly!
            Oh, sure, 'twill kill her alive!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He slipped the short, heavy monkey wrench up his right sleeve, walked out
      on deck and stood at the corner of the house, smoking placidly and gazing
      down on the main deck forward. The look-out on the forecastle head was not
      visible in the darkness, but Mr. Reardon was not worried about that. &ldquo;For
      why,&rdquo; he argued to himself, &ldquo;should I go lookin' for the skut whin if I
      wait a bit he'll come fluttherin' into me hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did. At five minutes after ten Mr. Schultz hailed the look-out in
      German, and although Mr. Reardon spoke no German, yet did he understand
      that order. Mr. Schultz, a victim of habit, desired the look-out to go to
      the galley and bring up some hot coffee for him and the helmsman. It was
      the custom aboard the <i>Narcissus</i>, as it is in most Pacific Coast
      boats, for the cook, just before retiring, to brew a pot of coffee, drain
      off the grounds and leave it to simmer on the galley range where, at
      intervals of two hours during the night, the watch could come and help
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence Reardon knew that the look-out, after heating the coffee and
      bringing a few cups up on the bridge, would return to the galley and
      partake of a cup and a bite himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came down off the forecastle head, crossed the main deck and
      disappeared in the galley. In about ten minutes Mr. Reardon saw him climb
      up the port companion to the bridge; a minute later he came down. Mr.
      Reardon waited until he was certain the fellow was sipping his coffee in
      the galley; then with the utmost nonchalance he went up on the bridge and
      hailed Mr. Schultz, who was standing amidships blowing on a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra,&rdquo; he complained, &ldquo;Divil a wink can I shleep to-night. I've been
      sittin' wit' the wireless operator all evenin', an' now, thinks I, he's
      weary listenin' to me nonsinse, so I'll go up on the bridge an' interview
      Misther Schultz. If I&mdash;be the Rock av Cashel! What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot? Vere?&rdquo; Mr. Schultz exclaimed, and set down his cup of coffee. He was
      all excitement, for he had been looking for the flash of a searchlight for
      the past hour and he wondered now if the unsuspecting Reardon had seen it
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over that way.&rdquo; Mr. Reardon pointed off the port bow. &ldquo;Did ye not see
      that light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A light. <i>Gott im Himmel!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can't see it now,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon replied soothingly. He stepped round to
      the back of the mate and permitted his trusty monkey wrench to slip down
      into his hand. &ldquo;But if ye continue to look in that direction, Misther
      Schultz, ye'll see not wan light but several.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Donnerwetter!</i> I gannot see dem,&rdquo; Mr. Schultz protested, wondering
      if there might not be some defect in his eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear. Keep lookin' that way an' ye'll see thim,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon
      reassured him. &ldquo;Ha-ha, ye divil!&rdquo; he crooned&mdash;and struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll gamble ye saw the lights I promised ye,&rdquo; he breathed into the ear of
      the unconscious mate as he deftly caught the falling body and eased it
      noiselessly to the deck to avoid calling the attention of the helmsman to
      the interesting tableau going on behind him. Quickly he gagged Mr. Schultz
      with a strip of canvas; then he tied his hands behind him and bound him at
      ankle and knee with the short lengths of signal halyard. As a final
      attention he &ldquo;frisked&rdquo; the mate and removed his keys and a heavy automatic
      pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie there now, me jewel,&rdquo; he said, and trotted out to the starboard end
      of the bridge, whistling shrilly &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo; When the swift
      patter of feet along the deck warned him that the steward was coming, he
      walked back amidships and opened the little sliding trap in the roof of
      the pilot-house, which on the <i>Narcissus</i> was set just below the
      bridge. The quartermaster's head was directly beneath the trap. &ldquo;Oh-ho, me
      laddybuck!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon murmured, and dropped his padded monkey wrench on
      that defenseless head. Instantly the quartermaster staggered and hung
      limply to the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck to me, I'll have to hit ye agin,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon complained&mdash;and
      did it. Then he slid through the trap into the pilot-house, steadied the
      wheel with one hand and unlocked the pilot-house door with the other to
      admit the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike me pink!&rdquo; that astounded functionary exclaimed as he gazed at the
      quartermaster lying beside the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;if ye don't take howld av this wheel an' do less talkln',&rdquo;
       Mr. Reardon replied evenly. &ldquo;Bring her round very slowly, me lad, an' in
      the intherval I'll wrap up me little Baby Bunting on the floor forninst
      ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the quartermaster had been duly wrapped <i>a la</i> Mr. Schultz and
      dragged clear of the wheel, Mr. Reardon returned to the bridge and with
      brazen impudence set the handle of the marine telegraph over to full speed
      ahead. He hummed &ldquo;Colleen Dhas Cruthin Amoe&rdquo; as with a light heart he
      skipped down to the galley and found the look-out eating bread soaked in
      coffee. Mr. Reardon nodded and said &ldquo;Good nicht, <i>amigo</i>&rdquo; for his
      voyages had taken him to many ports and he was naturally quick at picking
      up foreign languages. The fellow, concluding Mr. Reardon desired a cup of
      coffee also, turned to the rack to get him a cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare ye ate up the owners' groceries in this shameful manner?&rdquo; Mr.
      Reardon demanded. &ldquo;Do ye not get enough at mess that ye must be atin'
      between meals? Shame on you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One tap did the trick. &ldquo;'Tis a black way to repay a kind t'ought,&rdquo; Mr.
      Reardon observed to his victim as he bound and gagged him; &ldquo;but war is
      war, an' a faint heart an' a weak stomach never shtole a ship back from
      forty German pirates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the galley door on the unfortunate look-out and climbed up on
      the boat deck to get Michael J. Murphy out of prison. Cautiously he
      unlocked the state-room door with the key taken from Mr. Schultz, and the
      skipper came forth. Mr. Reardon led him under an electric light and gazed
      upon him wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra, Michael, me poor lad,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;be the look av the white
      face of you I'm thinkin' ye ought to be in bed instid av out raisin'
      ructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm weak; I have a fever,&rdquo; Murphy replied. &ldquo;Still, half that fever may be
      plain lunatic rage. Did you find a gun on the mate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. Take it, Michael, I'll have nothin' to do wit' it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper grasped the weapon eagerly. &ldquo;The ship is headed due west
      undher full speed,&rdquo; Terence explained, &ldquo;an' the mate, the quarter-master
      an' the look-out have all received evidence av me affectionate regard.
      Next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Von Staden. He kicked me and broke my ribs, Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wit' the greatest joy in life, Michael. The skut's busy in the wireless
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went to the wireless room. Von Staden was taking a message as they
      entered; at sound of their footsteps he turned carelessly and found
      himself looking down the muzzle of the captain's automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye take it peaceably, ye gossoon, or must I brain ye wit' this
      monkey wrench?&rdquo; Mr. Reardon queried fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And take your hand off that key, you blackguard. No S O S,&rdquo; Murphy
      ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo stared at them impudently. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;is
      one of those inconceivable contingencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your early education was neglected, Dutchy. However, don't complain and
      say I didn't give you warning. Terence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Michael?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well-regulated ships carry a few sets of handcuffs and leg irons. If
      you will put your hand in my right hip pocket, Terence, lad, you'll find a
      pair for present emergencies. They were in my desk and I concluded to
      bring them along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' a pious t'ought it was, Michael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they handcuffed Herr August Carl von Staden and gagged him, after which
      Mr. Reardon, leaving the skipper to guard his prisoner, ran round to his
      own room and got the two lengths of chain and the padlocks. When he
      returned, Michael J. Murphy kicked his unwelcome supercargo to the mate's
      store-room and Mr. Reardon locked him in among the paint pots, pipe, old
      iron and other odds and ends which accumulate in a mate's store-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went next to the door of the forecastle. It was open&mdash;and, what
      was better, it opened inward. Also, it was of steel with a stout brass
      ring on the lock, this ring taking the place of what on a landsman's door
      would have been a knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence Reardon and Michael J. Murphy listened. From within came a medley
      of gentle sighs, snores and the slow, regular breathing of sleeping men.
      Softly Mr. Reardon closed the door, turned the ring until the latch
      caught, drew a section of chain through the ring in such a manner as to
      prevent the latch from being released, passed the ends of his chain round
      the steel handrail along the front of the forecastle and padlocked them
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, thin,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon announced, &ldquo;that takes care av the carpenter, the
      bos'n, four seamen, two waiters an' the mess bhoy. Do ye wait here a
      minute, Michael, lad, whilst I run up on the bridge and give that
      unmintionable Schultz the wanst over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The weak, half-dead Murphy sat down on the hatch coaming and waited. The
      chief was away about ten minutes and the captain was on the point of
      investigating when Mr. Reardon appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That unfortunate divil had come to, an' was lookin' an' feelin' cowld
      whin I wint up on the bridge,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;so I wint to me room an' got
      a pair av blankets to wrap round him where he lay. It's wan thing to tap a
      man on the head, but 'tis another to let him catch his death av cowld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Murphy smiled. Ordinarily he would have laughed at the whimsical
      Terence, but he didn't have a good laugh left in him. His lung was
      hurting, so he suspected an abscess.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the boat deck, and with his rule Mr. Reardon carefully
      measured the exact distance between the ship's rail and the center of the
      doors of the state-rooms occupied by the mates and assistant engineers.
      This detail attended to, they went to the carpenter's little shop and cut
      two scantlings of a length to correspond to the measurements taken, and in
      addition Mr. Reardon prepared some thin cleats with countersunk holes for
      the insertion of screws. He worked very leisurely, and it was eleven
      o'clock when he had everything in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothin' to do now until midnight, whin the watch in the ingine
      room is changed,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon suggested, &ldquo;so lave us go to the galley. Wan
      av me brave lads is in there, an' if he's not dead intirely, faith, I'm
      thinkin' I might injoy a cup av coffee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went to the galley and found the look-out glaring at them. He made
      inarticulate noises behind his gag, so Mr. Reardon, much relieved, found
      seats for each of them and poured coffee. Then he filled his pipe, crossed
      his right leg over his left knee and puffed away. He was the speaking
      likeness of Contentment. And well he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first assistant engineer had been driving the <i>Narcissus</i> for an
      hour at full speed at right angles to the course he believed she was
      pursuing. He would, being totally ignorant of the change of masters,
      continue to drive her at full speed until midnight, when he would come off
      watch, tired and sleepy, and go straight to his state-room. The second
      assistant would go direct from his state-room to duty in the engine-room
      and continue to drive the <i>Narcissus</i> at full speed until four
      o'clock, and inasmuch as it would be quite dark still when the third
      assistant came on at four o'clock to relieve the engineer on watch, there
      was not the slightest doubt in the minds of Murphy and the chief but that
      the deception could go on until breakfast. However, that would interfere
      with their plans. Long before that hour the men locked in the forecastle
      would have discovered their plight, and the noise of the discovery might
      reach below decks and bring up, to investigate, just a few more husky
      firemen and coal passers than even the redoubtable Terence Reardon could
      hope to cope with successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By four o'clock we'll be more than fifty miles off the course Schultz was
      holding her on,&rdquo; the captain suggested. &ldquo;In all likelihood the German
      admiral wirelessed his last position and the course he was steering, and
      von Staden gave Schultz his course accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, we're not a moment too soon at that,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon replied.
      &ldquo;Schultz was lookin' for searchlights whin I tapped him. Be the Toe Nails
      av Moses ye're right, Michael. We'll be so far off that course be daylight
      they won't even see our shmoke. D'ye think that little handful av bones,
      Riggins, can manage the wheel until we've claned up the ingine-room gang?
      We can relieve him wit' wan av the Chinamen then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him he'll have to stick it out. And by the way, Terence, come to
      think of it, you had better run forward and remove the sidelights; then
      unscrew all of the incandescent lamps on deck until the contact is lost.
      You can screw them in again just before the watch is changed, so they
      won't suspect anything, and unscrew them again after we have the watch
      under lock and key. The fleet may be too far away to see our smoke by
      daylight, but they may be close enough to see our lights to-night! Tell
      Riggins to darken the pilot-house. The binnacle light is enough to keep
      him company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for ye,&rdquo; Terence replied, and hurried away to carry out Murphy's
      instructions.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At twelve o'clock the second assistant engineer, hurrying along the deck
      to relieve the first assistant on watch, found Mr. Reardon leaning over
      the rail meditatively puffing his old briar pipe. In answer to the
      former's query as to what kept the chief up so late, the latter replied
      that he was burning sulphur in his room to kill bedbugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good Lord forgive me the lie,&rdquo; he prayed when a few minutes later he
      was called upon by the first assistant, hurrying off watch, to repeat the
      same tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first assistant and his watch had a shower-bath and turned in. They
      were not interested in the workings of the deck department in the dark;
      they could not know that the vessel's course had been changed; they
      thought only of getting to sleep. Mr. Reardon waited until one-thirty A.
      M. to provide against possible sleepless ones, and then crept aft on
      velvet feet. The <i>Narcissus</i> had very commodious quarters in her
      stern, where her coolie crew had been housed in the days when she ran in
      the China trade; and when the Blue Star Navigation Company took her over
      these quarters had been fitted up to accommodate the engine room crew. In
      the same manner, therefore, that he had imprisoned the men of the deck
      department in the forecastle, Mr. Reardon now proceeded to imprison the
      men of the engine department in the sterncastle. This delicate mission
      accomplished, he went up top-side and measured the diameter of the
      ventilators, in order to make certain that the thinnest of his German
      canaries could not fly the cage via that difficult route. Having satisfied
      himself that he had no need to worry on this score, he made his way
      forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Michael, me poor lad,&rdquo; he announced as he rejoined the skipper,
      &ldquo;I'll tell you wan thing&mdash;an' it isn't two. The crew av the <i>Narcissus</i>
      off watch at this minute will never come on watch ag'in&mdash;in the <i>Narcissus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper smiled wanly. &ldquo;I'm sorry you must take all the risks and do
      all the work, Terence,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwan wit' ye, Michael. Sure if I had a head on me like you, an' a college
      edication in back av that ag'in, I'd be out playin' golf this minute wit'
      Andhrew Carnegie an' Jawn D. Rockefeller&mdash;ayther that, or I'd have
      been hung for walkin' away wit' the Treasury Buildin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the remaining details of that portion of the ship cleaning
      still before them. &ldquo;Remember, Terence,&rdquo; Mike Murphy warned the chief,
      &ldquo;when the blow-off comes at four o'clock and the uproar commences fore and
      aft, we have the means to keep them quiet. I'll go forward and you go aft.
      When we threaten to throw burning sulphur down the ventilators and
      suffocate them, they'll sing soft and low!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon chuckled. &ldquo;An' Schultz t'ought I was afther bedbugs whin I
      asked the shteward for the sulphur,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Shtill an' all,
      Michael,&rdquo; he added, a trifle wistfully, &ldquo;I could wish for a bit more
      excitement, considerin' the size av the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, Terry, you may get it yet. I'm dizzy and weak, chief; I'm
      fearful I'll not be able to last out the night&mdash;and these Germans are
      desperate. Suppose we go forward now, while I'm able, and awaken Mr.
      Henckel. It's high time he relieved Mr. Schultz, and he'll be waking
      naturally if we let him oversleep much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The subjugation of Mr. Henckel was accomplished without the slightest
      excitement or bloodshed. Mr. Reardon rapped at his door and Mr. Henckel
      replied sleepily in German. The skipper and the chief merely lurked, one
      on each side of his state-room door, until he stepped briskly out;
      whereupon the captain jabbed him with the gun while Mr. Reardon shook the
      monkey wrench under his nose. Indeed, Mr. Reardon had the gag in the
      second mate's mouth even while it hung open in surprise. They bound him
      hand and foot, and Mr. Reardon picked him up and tucked him gently in his
      berth, for, as the chief remarked to him, he was as safe there as anywhere
      and far more comfortable, although Mike Murphy objected and was for
      putting him in the mate's store-room with von Staden, whom they had put in
      the dirtiest and most unwholesome spot aboard the <i>Narcissus</i>, for
      two reasons: In the first place, he had kicked Michael J. Murphy and shot
      him through the shoulder; and in the second place, he was the cleanest
      German and the most wholesome pirate they had ever seen, and they figured
      the contrast would annoy him. Mr. Reardon, however, objected to this plan.
      He argued that von Staden would be glad of Mr. Henckel's company, and was
      it not their original intention to keep that laddybuck von Staden in
      solitary confinement? It was. They closed the state-room door on Mr.
      Henckel, and left him to meditate on his sins while they repaired to the
      carpenter's little shop, to return to the boat deck presently with the
      scantlings and cleats Mr. Reardon had prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the scantling the chief shored up the doors to the state-room
      occupied respectively at the time by the first and third assistant
      engineers; then he screwed the cleats into place at top and bottom, so the
      scantling could not slip. Not for worlds would he have used a hammer to
      nail them into place, for that would have spoiled the surprise for the
      objects of his attentions. Throughout the entire operation he was as
      silent as a burglar, although by way of additional precaution the captain
      stood by with drawn pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now thin, Michael,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon whispered as they pussy-footed away,
      &ldquo;there are six fine Germans below in the ingine room, an' two Irishmen an'
      half an Englishman on deck. The Chinee cooks don't count, for sure the
      poor heathens would only get excited and turrn somebody loose if we asked
      them to do anything desperate. And, as ye know, wan good Irishman&mdash;and
      bad luck to the man that says I am not that&mdash;can keep a hundhred
      Germans from comin' up out av that ingine room. Go to yer bed, Michael,
      an' lie down until I call ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better take this automatic,&rdquo; Murphy suggested, and showed him how to use
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Reardon resolutely refused to abandon his monkey wrench, although
      he consented to carry the automatic to Riggins in the pilot-house. The
      estimable Riggins had been steering a somewhat erratic course, for he
      found it impossible to keep his eye on the lubber's mark while the bound
      quartermaster glared balefully at him from the floor. Indeed Riggins had
      been pondering his fate should that husky Teuton ever get the upper hand
      again; hence, when he found himself in a state of preparedness and was
      informed that he must stick by the wheel until relieved, the prospect did
      not awe him in the least. The present odds were counterbalanced by the
      strategic position held by the minority, and Riggins was content.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way back to his state-room, there to rest until the final call to
      arms, Michael J. Murphy concluded it would be well to search the quarters
      of the second mate and Herr von Staden for contraband of war. So he did,
      with the result that he unearthed in von Staden's room the rifle and
      revolver which belonged to the <i>Narcissus</i>, and under the second
      mate's pillow he found another automatic pistol. He confiscated all three
      weapons by right of discovery, and hid the rifle in the galley, the last
      place anybody would think of looking for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Mr. Reardon proceeded further to strengthen his position
      by closing the port entrance to the engine room and shoring up the door
      with a stout scantling, cleated at top and bottom to hold it securely in
      place. Then he donned Mr. Schultz's heavy watchcoat, dragged round from
      the lee of the house the upholstered easy-chair Mrs. Reardon had insisted
      upon his taking to sea with him for use in his leisure moments, placed
      this chair on deck just outside the starboard entrance to the engine room,
      loaded his pipe, laid his trusty monkey wrench across his knee and gave
      himself up to the contemplation of this riot we call life. He resembled a
      cat watching beside a gopher hole. By half-past three o'clock he had
      finished figuring out approximately the amount of money Mrs. Reardon would
      have in the Hibernia Bank at the end of five years&mdash;figuring on a
      monthly saving of fifty dollars and interest compounded at the rate of
      four per cent. So, having satisfied himself that Johnny would yet be a
      lawyer and the girls learn to play the piano, Mr. Reardon heaved a sigh
      and reluctantly went to call Michael J. Murphy for the final accounting.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At ten minutes to four Mr. Uhl, the second assistant, a man of some thirty
      years and ordinarily possessed of a disposition as placid as that of a
      little Jersey heifer, ordered one of his firemen to go and call the watch
      to relieve them. Mr. Reardon, his monkey wrench firmly grasped in his
      right hand, knew that at exactly ten minutes to four Mr. Uhl would issue
      that order&mdash;so he was on the spot to receive the fireman as the
      latter came leisurely up the greasy steel stairway. As the fellow emerged
      on deck he paused to wipe his heated brow with a sweat rag and draw in a
      welcome breath of cool fresh air. He did not succeed in getting his lungs
      quite full, however, for Michael J. Murphy, lurking beside the door,
      thrust the barrel of his gun in the fireman's ribs, effectually curtailing
      the process of respiration practically at once. From the other side of the
      door the chief engineer stepped out and wagged his bludgeon under the
      fireman's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ach!</i>&rdquo; Mr. Reardon coughed, and grimaced pleasantly. &ldquo;<i>Schmierkase
      und Sauerkraut</i>, ye big shtiff! <i>Vat wilse du haben</i>, eh? <i>Zwei
      bier?</i> Damn the weather, as Misther Schultz would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his finger on his lips, enjoining silence; then with the same
      finger he pointed sternly onward, and the fireman took the hint. In the
      clear space aft the house and next to the funnel Mr. Reardon bound and
      gagged him and laid him tenderly on his back to await developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now thin, Michael,&rdquo; he said to the skipper, &ldquo;lave us go back an' see can
      we catch another. At four o'clock, whin this lad fails to return, Misther
      Uhl, the omadhaun, will sind up another man to see what the divil ails the
      firrst man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was even so. This time it was the oiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five minutes after four a coal passer came up the stairs, and he was
      swearing at the delay in being relieved. Something told Mr. Reardon this
      fellow would make trouble, so without warning he hit the coal passer a
      light rap &ldquo;to take the conceit out av him.&rdquo; Two minutes later the coal
      passer had joined his fellows beside the funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter after four Mr. Uhl scratched his head and said something very
      explosive in German. He started up the stairs, got halfway up&mdash;and
      came down. It had occurred to him very suddenly that three men had already
      gone up the stairs and had failed to return. He called a fireman and gave
      him some very explicit orders in German; whereupon the man disappeared in
      the shaft alley. Five minutes later he returned, pop-eyed with excitement
      and the bearer of a tale that caused Mr. Uhl to arch his blond eyebrows
      and murmur dazedly &ldquo;<i>So?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed. Mr. Reardon glanced interrogatively at Michael J.
      Murphy. &ldquo;I think the divils are suspicious,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;We should have
      had another be now. Have a care now, Michael. Whin they come they come
      wit' a rush an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pistol shot echoed through the ship. It came up from forward. Three more
      followed in rapid succession&mdash;a scream&mdash;a shout!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the divil damn me!&rdquo; Terence Reardon cried in a horrified voice. &ldquo;I
      clane forgot the little companion hatch at the ind av the shaft alley.
      They've crawled down the shaft alley an' up on deck at the very sterrn av
      the ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dashed aft towards the spot where his prisoners were laid out close to
      the funnel. As he turned the corner of the house he observed that the
      electric lamp which he had so carefully screwed out of its socket had been
      screwed in again, and by its light Terence beheld no less a person than
      Mr. Uhl cutting the halyards that bound the oiler. The fireman had already
      been cut loose, but the potent effects of Terence Reardon's blow with the
      wrench still remained; though conscious, the man was unfit for combat. The
      coal passer, evidently the first man to be rescued by Mr. Uhl, was
      standing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gower that, ye divils!&rdquo; Mr. Reardon shrieked, and charged, swinging his
      monkey wrench with all his horsepower. He missed his first stroke at Mr.
      Uhl, who very deftly stabbed him high up on the hip for his carelessness;
      then the chief swung again, and Mr. Uhl was out of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so the big coal passer, however. He planted in Terence Reardon's face
      as pretty a left and right&mdash;hay-makers both&mdash;as one could hope
      to see anywhere outside a prize-ring; whereupon the chief took the count
      with great abruptness. The fireman reached for the monkey wrench&mdash;and
      at that instant the weak, pale-faced skipper lurched around the corner of
      the house and his automatic commenced to bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a time for sentiment. Michael J. Murphy glanced once at Terence
      Reardon's bloody, upturned face, and the glazed eyes thrilled him with
      horror. The chief engineer was dead! That meant that Michael J. Murphy
      would soon be dead, too. Well, they had fought a good fight and lost, so
      nothing now remained for him to do save slaughter as many of the enemy as
      possible and go to his accounting like a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on the heap of bloody, prostrate men, stepped over a
      little rivulet of gore that ran rapidly toward the scupper as the ship
      heeled to port, then hesitated and started back as she heeled to
      starboard. He was vaguely conscious that Mr. Uhl had shut down his engines
      before coming on deck and that in consequence the ship had lost headway
      and was beginning to wallow. In his weak state her plunging caused him to
      stagger like a drunken man. As he crossed to the port side of the ship and
      gazed down the deck he noticed that the incandescent lamps had all been
      screwed back in their sockets, and by their brilliant light he beheld one
      of the firemen in the act of removing the scantling from before the first
      assistant's door. Just as the door swung open the captain fired, but
      evidently missed, for the man sprang nimbly into the state-room for
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the great European War has proved nothing else to date, it has
      demonstrated one comforting thing about the German people: one does not
      grow impatient waiting for them to carry the fight to him. The fireman had
      no sooner entered the first assistant's state-room than the first
      assistant came out. He was wearing his pajamas and a piece of young
      artillery, and without the slightest embarrassment he commenced shooting
      at Michael J. Murphy, who, not to be outdone in politeness while he could
      stand and see, promptly returned the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first assistant's first shot nipped a neat little crescent out of Mike
      Murphy's large red right ear; his second ripped clean through the inside
      of the skipper's left leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High and then low,&rdquo; was the thought that capered through Mike Murphy's
      brain. &ldquo;God grant he don't get me through the middle! That's what comes of
      fast shooting&mdash;so I guess I'll go slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electric lamp over his head was shattered and the fragments scattered
      round him as he leaned against the corner of the house and took careful
      aim at the first assistant, who missed his next shot by a whisker and died
      in his tracks with two cartridges still in his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazedly Michael J. Murphy advanced along the deck, stepped over the body
      and entered the state-room. In the corner the fireman crouched, hands
      uplifted in token of surrender, so the skipper closed the door and shored
      it up again with the scantling. Mechanically he picked up the first
      assistant's huge revolver, broke it, removed the cartridges and threw them
      overboard. Then he slipped a clip of seven cartridges into his automatic
      and staggered round to Mr. Henckel's state room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was open. The bird had flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy went in and sat down on Mr. Henckel's settee, for he was
      very weak and dizzy; and at least nobody could shoot at him in there.
      &ldquo;Come, come, Michael,&rdquo; he croaked, &ldquo;no going out this voyage. You have
      work ahead of you. Pull yourself together and let us count noses. Now
      then, there were two firemen, two coal passers, one oiler and Mr. Uhl on
      watch. Terence killed Mr. Uhl with the monkey wrench, I killed the big
      coal passer, I think I killed the oiler, and one fireman was out of the
      scrap from the beginning. Then I killed the first assistant and locked the
      other fireman in his room. That leaves Mr. Henckel and a coal passer to be
      reckoned with. Now there was some shooting up forward and somebody was
      hit. That means Riggins shot somebody or somebody shot Riggins. The second
      mate probably went forward to let the men out of the forecastle, while the
      fireman went aft to let the engine-room gang out of the sterncastle. They
      haven't had time to do it yet; they'll have to pry those rings out of the
      door with a crowbar. I'll go aft and drive the fireman forward; when I
      have them bunched I'll argue with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at the break of the house and looked down on the deck aft. The
      lights had been turned on and a man was just raising a short crowbar to
      attack the door, from behind which came shouts and cries of anger and
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy rested his automatic on the deck rail and fired twice at the
      man in front of the sterncastle door. The fellow fled at once dashing
      along the deck, zigzag fashion, to distract the skipper's aim, and
      disappeared in the dark entrance to the starboard alleyway. So Michael J.
      Murphy slid down the companion and followed into the alleyway, firing two
      shots for luck as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he disappeared into the murk amidships when Terence Reardon
      rolled groggily down the companion after him. Terence had no means of
      ascertaining which alleyway the skipper had charged into&mdash;and he did
      not care. Blind with fury he lurched into the port alleyway; in
      consequence of which the fugitive, fleeing ahead of the captain down the
      starboard alleyway and thinking to turn down the port alleyway and double
      back to complete his labors at the sterncastle door, bumped squarely into
      the chief engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon said no word, but wrapped his arms round the man and held the
      latter close to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for a moment they stood, gripping each other, each wondering whether
      the other was friend or foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Reardon decided that even if his nose was bloody he could not
      possibly be mistaken in the odor of a fireman just come off watch. He had
      lost his monkey wrench in the <i>melee</i> on the upper deck&mdash;the
      defunct Mr. Uhl having fallen upon it, thereby obscuring it from Mr.
      Reardon's very much befogged vision, but his soul was still undaunted, for
      Mr. Reardon, in common with most chief engineers still in their prime,
      firmly believed that he could trounce any fireman he saw fit to employ. He
      bit suddenly into the fireman's cheek just where the flesh droops in a
      fold over the lower jaw, and was fortunate enough to secure a grip that
      bade fair to hold; then he crooked his leg at the back of his opponent's
      and slowly shoved the fellow's head backward. They came down together, Mr.
      Reardon on top, content for once to hold his man helpless&mdash;and rest&mdash;while
      his enemy's shrieks of pain and rage resounded through the ink-black
      alleyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy heard that uproar and halted. After listening a few
      seconds he came to the conclusion that a German was in deep distress, and
      that hence it was no part of his business to interfere. Besides, he had
      business of his own to attend to. He could hear a chain rattling up
      forward, and while it was too dark to see who or what was doing the
      rattling, he found Mr. Henckel guilty on mere suspicion, and fired at the
      sound; whereupon somebody said &ldquo;<i>Ach, Gott!</i>&rdquo; in tones of deep
      disgust, two little flashes of fire cut the dark, and two bullets
      whispered of death as they flew harmlessly down the alleyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Mike Murphy returned the salute, firing at the other's flashes;
      then he fell to the deck and rolled over into the scupper to escape the
      return fire, which was not slow in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where the devil he got that gun,&rdquo; was Murphy's comment. &ldquo;Mr. Uhl
      must have had it in his pocket and lent it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was profound silence within the forecastle, and pending the
      destruction of his attacker Mr. Henckel judged it imprudent to make any
      further attempts at a delivery. He required time to formulate a plan of
      attack, and in the interim he desired shelter. Mike Murphy heard the
      patter of feet, the patter ceasing almost as soon as it commenced&mdash;and
      he smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's hiding,&rdquo; the captain soliloquized. &ldquo;Now, where would I take shelter
      if I were in his fix? Why, back of the hatch-coaming, of course&mdash;or
      the winch.&rdquo; He had a sudden inspiration and called aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riggins! Riggins! Answer me, Riggins. This is Captain Murphy calling
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ere, sir,&rdquo; came the voice of Riggins from the pilot-house above. The
      voice was very weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb out of the pilot-house, Riggins, to the bridge, turn on the
      searchlight and bend it down here on the deck till I get a shot at this
      scoundrel. Don't be afraid of him, Riggins. It's Henckel and he can't
      shoot for beans. Get the light fair on him and keep it on him; it'll blind
      him and he won't be able to shoot you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dirty dawg!&rdquo; snarled Riggins wearily. &ldquo;'E come up on the bridge a
      while&mdash;ago&mdash;an' I drove 'im off&mdash;but 'e plugged me, sir&mdash;through
      the guts, sir&mdash;an' me a married man! Wot in 'ell'll my ol' woman&mdash;say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was the last word Riggins ever spoke. True, he managed to crawl
      out of the pilot-house and up the short companion to the bridge; he
      reached the searchlight, and while Mr. Henckel and Mike Murphy swapped
      shots below him he turned on the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bend it on the deck, Riggins. On the deck, my bully, on the deck,&rdquo; Mike
      Murphy pleaded as the great beam of white light shot skyward and remained
      there; nor could all of Murphy's pleading induce Riggins to bend it on the
      deck, for Riggins was lying dead beside the searchlight, while ten miles
      away an officer on the flying bridge of H.M.S. Panther watched that finger
      of light pointing and beckoning with each roll of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something awf'lly queer, what?&rdquo; he commented when reporting it to his
      superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; the superior replied laconically. &ldquo;It can't be the Dresden and
      neither is it one of ours. We'll skip over and have a look at her, Reggie,
      my son.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy had two shots left in his automatic, and he was saving
      those for daylight and Mr. Henckel's rush, when a searchlight came
      nickering and feeling its way across the dark waters. Slowly, slowly it
      lifted and rested on the big blunt bows of the <i>Narcissus</i>, hovered
      there a few seconds and came slowly aft, and as it lighted up the main
      deck Mr. Henckel rose from behind the hatch-coaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Deutschland uber Alles!</i>&rdquo; he yelled joyously&mdash;and rushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence Reardon, having pounded his firemen into insensibility, had crept
      down the port alleyway, and, unknown to Captain Murphy and Mr. Henckel, he
      had, from the opposite side of the deck, watched the flashes of their
      pistols as they fired at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to flank that fella an' put a shtop to this nonsense,&rdquo; Mr.
      Reardon decided presently, and forthwith crept across the deck on his
      hands and knees until he reached the hatch-coaming. Mr. Henckel lurked
      just round the other corner of the coaming, so close Mr. Reardon could
      hear him breathing. And there the crafty chief had waited until Mr.
      Henckel rose for his charge&mdash;whereupon Mr. Reardon rose also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ireland upper always, ye vagabone!&rdquo; he yelled, and launched himself at
      Mr. Henckel's knees. It was a perfect tackle and the second mate went down
      heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an emergency such as the present all Terence Reardon asked was good
      fighting light. Fighting in the dark distressed him, he discovered, for
      while polishing off the fireman in the black alleyway he had missed one
      punch at the fellow's head, and had been reminded to his sorrow and the
      ruin of his knuckles, that the deck of the Narcissus was of good Norway
      pine. However, H.M.S. Panther was scarcely three cable lengths distant
      now, and the officer on her flying bridge could see that some sort of a
      jolly row was in progress on the deck of the Narcissus; so he kept the
      searchlight on the combatants while Mr. Reardon bent Mr. Henckel's back
      over the hatch-coaming, took his automatic away from him, and proceeded to
      take a cast of the mate's features in the vulcanite butt of the weapon.
      And vulcanite is far from soft!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Terence Reardon had completed his self-appointed task he stood up,
      hitched his dungarees, spat blood on the deck, and stood waving from side
      to side like a dancing bear. His face was unrecognizable; his dungarees,
      so neat and clean when he donned them the night before, were now one vast
      smear of red, and he grinned horribly, for he was war mad!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next!&rdquo; he croaked, and turned to the master for orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Michael Joseph Murphy was out of the fight. He lay prone on the deck,
      conscious but helpless, and because his broken rib was tickling his lung
      the froth on his lips bore a little tinge of pink. Only his eyes moved&mdash;and
      they smiled at Terence Reardon as the triumphant exiles of Erin faced each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence Reardon turned and shook his battered fists full into the rays of
      the searchlight. He was magnificent for one brief instant; then the
      war-madness left him, and again he was plain, faithful, whimsical,
      capable, honest Terence P. Reardon, chief engineer of the S.S. Narcissus,
      who considered it a pleasure to discourse on the fairies when he had
      nothing more important to do. Now that the fight was over and the German
      fleet had overhauled them at last, he had time to think of Mrs. Reardon
      and the children and his best job gone for ever&mdash;tossed into the
      discard with his honor as a faithful servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down very suddenly on the hatch-coaming and covered his terrible
      face with his terrible hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Norah! Norah!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;and sobbed as if his heart must break.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Captain the Hon. Desmond O'Hara, of H.M.S. Panther, boarded the
      steamer Narcissus via the Jacob's ladder Mr. Reardon hove overside at his
      command, he paused a moment, balanced on the ship's rail, and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; he said, and leaped to the deck, to make room for a
      pink-and-white middy. The pink-and-white one stared and said &ldquo;My aunt!&rdquo;
       Then he, too, leaped to the deck, and a stocky cockney blue-jacket poked
      his nose over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn my eyes!&rdquo; said this individual. &ldquo;'Ere's a bloomin' mess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo; Captain Desmond O'Hara demanded, pointing to the
      semiconscious Mr. Henckel, who was moaning and saying things in his mother
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr. Reardon with a familiar wink, &ldquo;was a fine, decent German
      until I operated on him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I observed. And who might you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me name is Terence P. Reardon, an' I'm the chief engineer av the United
      Shtates steamer <i>Narcissus</i>, av San Francisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! An Irish-American, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon looked down at the deck, smiled a cunning little smile and
      looked up at Captain O'Hara. &ldquo;Well, sor,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I had me hyphen
      wit' me whin I shipped; as late as yestherd'y afthernoon 'twas in good
      worrkin' ordher; but what wit' the exertion av chasin' our Gerrman crew
      round the decks, faith I've lost me hyphen, an' I'm thinkin' the skipper's
      lost his too. That's him forninst ye. For the prisent he's in dhrydock
      awaitin' repairs, which leaves me in command av the ship. And since he's
      in no condition to go to his shtate-room an' unlock the ship's safe, an'
      sorra wan av me knows the combination, the divil a look will ye have at
      our papers. I'll save time an' throuble for us all be tellin' ye now that
      we've ten t'ousand tons av soft coal undher deck, that we cleared from
      Norfolk, Virginia, for Manila or Batavia, Pernambuco for ordhers, an' that
      we're a couple av t'ousand miles off our course. So confiscate the ship
      an' be damned to ye! Only I'm hopin' ye'll not be above takin' a bit av
      advice from wan who knows. There's a Gerrman fleet not far off, an' if ye
      shtop to monkey wit' us, faith ye may live to regret it&mdash;an' ye may
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain the Hon. Desmond O'Hara smiled sweetly. &ldquo;Divil a fear,&rdquo; he said,
      in no way cast down. &ldquo;We met the beggars off the Falklands yesterday and
      sunk them all but the Dresden. She slipped away from us in the dark,
      making for the mainland, and we were looking for her when we saw your
      searchlight cutting up such queer didos, so the Panther dropped behind to
      investigate. Had it not been for your searchlight we would have missed
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' be the same token a little dead Englishman signalled ye.&rdquo; Mr. Reardon
      gave another hitch to his dungarees. &ldquo;Sor,&rdquo; he said doggedly, &ldquo;I never
      t'ought I'd live to see the day I'd want to cheer a British victh'ry&mdash;but
      I do.&rdquo; He glanced down at his right hand and shook his head. &ldquo;Englishmen
      that ye are,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I'll not offer ye a hand like that&mdash;much
      as I want to shake hands wit' ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, don't let that worry you, Mr. Reardon. I'm not an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the divil's name, you're not an&mdash;an&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an Irishman! My name is Desmond O'Hara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon was fully aware that here was a grand specimen of the kind of
      Irish he had been taught to despise&mdash;the Irish that take the king's
      shilling, the gentlemen Irish that lead the king's cockneys into battle.
      And yet, strange to say, no thought of that entered his head now. He
      stepped up to Captain O'Hara, looked round cautiously as if expecting to
      be overheard, winked knowingly and whispered, as he jerked a significant
      thumb toward the unhappy Mr. Henckel: &ldquo;Sure 'tis the likes av us that can
      take the measure av the likes av thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Captain O'Hara, and reached for Terry Reardon's awful
      hand. &ldquo;It is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they lifted Michael J. Murphy into a boson's chair, the jackies
      unslung a cargo derrick, Mr. Reardon went to the winch, and the skipper
      was hoisted overside into the <i>Panther's</i> boat and taken aboard the
      warship for medical attention. Just before Mr. Reardon hoisted him he drew
      the chief's ear down to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About von Staden,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I thought I wanted to see him hung.
      Legally he's a pirate; but, Terence, he was raised wrong; you know,
      Terence&mdash;<i>Deutschland ueber Alles</i>. These Dutch devils thought
      it was all right to steal our ship&mdash;national necessity, you know. Let
      von Staden out of the mate's store-room and tell him the English have us&mdash;that
      his fleet is gone. Then turn your back on him, Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon followed orders. &ldquo;Captain Murphy ordhered me to let ye out,&rdquo;
       he explained to the supercargo, &ldquo;an' towld me to turrn me back on ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please thank him for me,&rdquo; von Staden replied gently. &ldquo;I scarcely expected
      such kindness at his hands. You may turn your back now, Mr. Reardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Reardon turned his back, and, despite the rush of the British
      jackies to stop him, Herr August Carl von Staden reached the rail. &ldquo;<i>Deutschland
      ueber Alles!</i>&rdquo; he shouted defiantly&mdash;and jumped. He did not come
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain the Hon. Desmond O'Hara removed his cap. &ldquo;They die so infernally
      well,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;one hates to fight them&mdash;individually.
      Yesterday the <i>Nuernberg</i> fell to us. We outranged her, and when she
      was out of action and sinking, with her men swimming and drowning all
      round her, the <i>Panther</i> was stripped of life preservers in two
      minutes. Some of my lads went overboard to help the Boche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reardon remembered he had wrapped waste round the head of his monkey
      wrench and curtailed his indicated horse-power when tapping individuals;
      yet, when he fought them in bulk, with what savage joy had he struck down
      Mr. Uhl, a poor, inoffensive devil and the victim of a false ideal of
      national honor! Mr. Reardon was quite sure he despised Englishmen; yet the
      tears came to his eyes when the jackies carried poor little Riggins away
      from the searchlight, and he prayed for eternal rest for the soul of his
      late assistants, for he had learned in a night, as he fought with tooth
      and fist and monkey wrench, what those who fight with tongue and
      typewriter will never learn&mdash;that racial and religious animosities
      are just a pitiful human bugaboo&mdash;in bulk. Only that valiant minority
      that sheds its blood for the heartless majority can ever know this great
      truth&mdash;and the pity of it&mdash;that warriors never hate each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are too generous for that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Capt. Matt Peasley, with his heart in his throat, called up the British
      consul at San Francisco. Cappy Ricks, looking very pale and unhappy,
      sagged in his chair, while Mr. Skinner stood by, gnawing his nails and
      looking as if he would relish being kicked from one end of California
      Street to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; Matt Peasley began. Cappy Ricks shuddered and closed his eyes.
      &ldquo;Is this the British consul's office?... This is Captain Peasley, of the
      Blue Star Navigation Company... Yes... About our steamer <i>Narcissus</i>...
      You say the consul is on his way down to our office... Thank you...
      Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks sighed like an old air-compressor. &ldquo;I hope I live till he gets
      here,&rdquo; he declared feebly. &ldquo;Deliberate race, the British. No pep. Never
      get anywhere in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if to give the lie to Cappy's criticisms, the British consul was
      admitted at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he announced as the heart-broken trio gathered round him, &ldquo;I
      have some very grave news for you.&rdquo; His voice was vaguely reminiscent of
      that of the foreman in a quarry who calls upon a lady to inform her that
      her husband has just been caught in a premature blast and that the boys
      will be up with the pieces directly. &ldquo;Your steamer <i>Narcissus</i>,
      loaded with ten thousand tons of coal, has been captured a hundred miles
      north-east of the Falkland Islands by His Majesty's cruiser <i>Panther</i>.
      In view of your vessel's clearance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low moan broke from Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tightwad!&rdquo; he reviled. &ldquo;Old Alden P. Tightwad, the prince of misers! He
      thought he'd add a couple of ten-dollar bills to his roll, so he
      encouraged his skipper to hire a lot of interned Germans to work his ships
      in neutral trade! He was penny-wise and pound-foolish, so he cut out the
      wireless to save a miserable hundred and forty dollars a month. Bids are
      invited for the privilege of killing the damned old fool&mdash;Skinner!
      What are you looking at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-n-nothing!&rdquo; stammered Mr. Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't be looked at that way, Skinner. I have my faults, I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ssshh!&rdquo; Matt Peasley interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I won't be 'sshh-ed' at either. I lost the ship. I admit it. I O.K.'d
      the charter, and Murphy did his best to save her for us and couldn't. I'm
      the goat, but if it busts me I'll reimburse you two boys for every cent
      you have lost through my carelessness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; the consul interrupted. &ldquo;Pray permit me to
      proceed. The circumstances attending this case are so very unusual&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mister British Consul, I shall not argue the matter with you.
      You're too bally deliberate, and, besides, what's the use? The ship is
      gone. Let her go. We'll build another twice as big. Of course I could give
      you an excuse, but if I did you'd think I was old Nick Carter come to
      life. We'll just have to take it up through our State Department, present
      our alibi, and try to win her back in the prize court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will never be sent to a prize court, Mr. Ricks. It doesn't require a
      prize court to decide the case of the steamer <i>Narcissus</i>. The
      evidence is too overwhelming. There could not possibly be a reversal of
      the decision of our admiral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner sat down suddenly to keep from falling down. The consul
      continued: &ldquo;The commander of the <i>Panther</i>, Captain Desmond O'Hara&mdash;by
      the way, an old schoolmate of mine&mdash;has sent me a long private report
      on the affair; by wireless, of course, and in code. It appears that in
      Pernambuco harbor your German crew overpowered the captain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Cappy, Matt and Skinner in chorus. &ldquo;You admit that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, Mr. Ricks. And last night your chief engineer, Mr. Terence
      Reardon, with the aid of the steward, one Riggins&mdash;a British subject
      and unfortunately killed in the affray&mdash;and Captain Murphy
      overpowered the German crew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ricks!&rdquo; gasped Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Matt!&rdquo; shrilled Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cappy!&rdquo; yelled Matt Peasley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; laughed the British consul. &ldquo;They stole her back,
      gentlemen, and when Captain O'Hara found her rolling helplessly and
      boarded her, she was a shambles. Dead men tell no tales, Mr. Ricks&mdash;yet
      it was impossible for any fair-minded man to doubt the testimony of the
      dead men aboard your <i>Narcissus</i>! Her killed, wounded and prisoners
      formed a perfect alibi. In the meantime, Mr. Reardon and Captain Murphy
      are aboard the Panther, receiving medical attention, and will be returned
      to duty in a few weeks; the <i>Narcissus</i> is proceeding to meet the
      other ships of our fleet. She will coal them at sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've confiscated her cargo?&rdquo; Matt Peasley demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should worry about the cargo if they give us back our vessel,&rdquo; Cappy
      Ricks declared happily. &ldquo;We haven't received our freight money, of course,
      but by the time I get through with the charterers they'll pay the freight
      and ask no questions about the coal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We confiscated it, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; the British consul continued, &ldquo;for the
      reason that it was German coal. The supercargo who boarded the vessel at
      Pernambuco told your captain his people had paid cash for it to the
      charterers. But we're going to give you back your vessel because we
      haven't any moral right to keep her, since her owners have committed no
      breach of international law. The supercargo left fifteen thousand dollars
      behind him when he jumped overboard, but Captain O'Hara declined to
      confiscate that. At Captain Murphy's suggestion it will be forwarded to
      the widow of the man Riggins. Captain O'Hara especially requested that I
      call upon you and inform you that you have two of the finest Irishmen in
      the world to thank for your ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mister Consul. By the way, can you reach Captain O'Hara by
      wireless? If you can, I should be glad to pay for a message if you will
      send it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell him the Blue Star Navigation Company thanks him for the
      courtesy of his message, but that it does not agree with his statement
      that we have two Irishmen to thank for our ship. We think we have three! I
      know the Irish. The scoundrels never go back on each other in a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consul laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, as he took up his hat preparatory to leaving, &ldquo;your
      ship is now equipped with wireless&mdash;a fine, powerful plant such as
      they use in the German Navy. The supercargo brought it aboard at
      Pernambuco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley, the Yankee, came to life at that. &ldquo;Has that been
      confiscated, too?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain. However, we have confiscated that German crew of yours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; yelled Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and loaned you a crew of British seamen from the tramp <i>Surrey
      Maid</i>. The <i>Scharnhorst</i> torpedoed her off the coast of Chile, and
      we found her crew on board one of the German transports when we captured
      them after the fleet was destroyed. You're all fixed up, from skipper to
      cabin boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wireless operator, too?&rdquo; Matt Peasley cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consul nodded. &ldquo;He's got a steady job,&rdquo; the youthful president
      declared, and turned to Cappy Ricks for confirmation of this edict. But
      Cappy, the pious old codger, had bowed his head on his breast and they
      heard him mutter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, I thank Thee! All unworthy as I am, Lord, thou loadest me with
      favors&mdash;including a wireless plant, free gratis!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long after the British consul had departed Cappy Ricks sat alone in his
      office, dozing. Presently he roused and rang for Mr. Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Matt reports that the late Riggins made an allotment
      of his wages to his wife when he shipped aboard the <i>Narcissus</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riggins's wages hereafter shall constitute a charge against the <i>Narcissus</i>
      while Mrs. Riggins lives and while the Blue Star Navigation Company can
      afford to give up seventy dollars every month. Attend to it, Skinner.
      Another thing, Skinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to do something for Murphy and Reardon. Now then, Skinner,
      you've never had a chance to be a sport heretofore, but you're a
      stockholder in the Blue Star Navigation Company now, and as such I feel
      that I should not use my position, as owner of a controlling interest in
      the stock of the company, to give away the property of the company in an
      arbitrary fashion. So I'm going to leave it up to you, Skinner, to suggest
      what we shall do for them. I believe you will agree with me that we should
      do something very handsome by those two boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir, quite so. Well, to start off with, Mr. Ricks, I think we
      ought to pay their hospital bills, if any. Then I think we ought to give
      each of them a handsome gold watch, suitably engraved and with a small
      blue star&mdash;sapphires, you know&mdash;set in the front of the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel that would about fill the bill, eh, Skinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, next Christmas I think we ought to give them each a month's
      salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! You do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I think that would be a very delicate thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy sighed. Poor Skinner! Victim of the saving habit! Decent devil&mdash;didn't
      mean to be small, but just couldn't help it. A bush-leaguer&mdash;Skinner.
      Never meant for big company&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In addition&mdash;&rdquo; Skinner began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Skinner, my boy. Go on, go on, old horse. Now then, in addition&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like the wildest extravagance, Mr. Ricks, but those men have
      fought for their ship and I&mdash;remember, Mr. Ricks, this is only a
      suggestion&mdash;I think it would be a very&mdash;er&mdash;tactful thing
      to do to&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll choke him before he gets it out,&rdquo; Cappy soliloquized. Aloud he
      said: &ldquo;Go on, Skinner, my dear boy. Don't be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a time like this, when freights are so good and vessel property pays
      so well, it seems to me&mdash;that is, if you and Matt have no objection&mdash;that
      we ought to give Mike and Terence a&mdash;er&mdash;a little piece of the
      <i>Narcissus</i>&mdash;the ship&mdash;er&mdash;they love&mdash;say&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;ten-thousand-dollar
      interest&mdash;each&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Skinner! You came through at last, didn't you? The
      president emeritus agrees with you, Skinner, and it is so ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now skip along and wireless the glad news to Mike and Terence. Tell them
      when they have the coal out to proceed to Rio and load manganese ore.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In due course Captain Michael J. Murphy and Mr. Terence Reardon came off
      the dry dock, the sole visible evidence of that unrecorded second naval
      engagement off the Falkland Islands being a slight list to starboard on
      the part of the Reardon nose, and a notch in Murphy's right ear. Mr.
      Skinner had had a local jeweler prepare the presentation watches against
      the day of the home-coming of the warriors of the Blue Star, and on a
      Saturday night Cappy gave a banquet to Mike and Terence, and every
      employee of the Ricks' interests who could possibly attend, was present to
      do the doughty pair honor and cheer when the awards for valor were duly
      made by Cappy and congratulatory speeches made by Mr. Skinner and Matt
      Peasley. It was such a gala occasion that Cappy drank three cocktails,
      battened down by a glass or two of champagne, and as a result was ill for
      two days thereafter. When he recovered, he announced sadly and solemnly
      that he was about to retire&mdash;forever; that nothing of a business
      nature should ever be permitted to drag him back into the harness again.
      Then he bade all of his employees a touching farewell, packed his golf
      clubs, and disappeared in the general direction of Southern California. He
      was away so long that eventually even the skeptical Mr. Skinner commenced
      to wonder if, perchance, the age of miracles had not yet passed and Cappy
      had really retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! On the morning of December 24th, Cappy suddenly appeared at the
      office, his kindly old countenance aglow like a sunrise on the Alps.
      Immediately he cited Mr. Skinner to appear with the payrolls of all of the
      Ricks enterprises and show what cause, if any, existed, why there should
      not be a general whooping up of salaries to the deserving all along the
      line. The Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company had already declared a
      Christmas dividend; the accounts of every ship in the Blue Star fleet had
      been made up to date and a special Christmas dividend declared, and, in
      accordance with ancient custom, Cappy had appeared to devote one day in
      the year to actual labor. Christmas dividend checks and checks covering
      Christmas presents to his employees were always signed by him; it was his
      way of letting the recipients know that, although retired, he still kept a
      wary eye on his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had writer's cramp by the time he finished, but while the spending
      frenzy was on him he would take no rest; so he seized a pencil and, while
      Mr. Skinner called off the names of the deserving and the length of time
      each had spent in the Ricks service, Cappy scrawled a five, a ten or a
      twenty beside each name. Thus, in time, they came to the first name on the
      Blue Star pay roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Peasley, president; salary, ten thousand dollars a year; length
      of service, four months,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner intoned. &ldquo;How about a raise for
      Captain Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy laid down his pencil and looked at Skinner over the rims of his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;you're only drawing twelve thousand a year,
      and you've been with me twenty-five years! And here I'm giving this boy
      Matt ten thousand a year and he's been on the pay roll only four months.
      Why, it isn't fair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, he was three years in the Blue Star ships that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't consider that at all when raising salaries. The salaries of ship's
      officers are fixed and immutable anyhow, and when considering raises for
      my employees. I can take into consideration only the length of time
      they've been directly under my eye. Cut Matt's salary to five thousand a
      year and let him grow up with the business. His dividends from his Ricks
      L. &amp; L. and Blue Star stock will keep him going, and he hasn't any
      household bills to keep up. He and Florry live with me, and I'm the goat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear Matt will not take kindly to that program, Mr. Ricks&mdash;particularly
      at this time, when every ship in the offshore fleet is paying for herself
      every voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Cappy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner replied hesitatingly, &ldquo;perhaps I have no business to
      tell you this, because the knowledge came to me quite by accident; but the
      fact of the matter is, Matt is going to build himself an auxiliary
      schooner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; Cappy piped. &ldquo;That's the ticket for soup! An auxiliary
      schooner with semi-Diesel engines, four masts and about a million-foot
      lumber capacity would be a mighty good investment right now. Every yard in
      the country that builds steel vessels is filled up with orders, but our
      coast shipyards can turn out wooden vessels in a hurry; and, with
      auxiliary power, they'll pay five hundred per cent on their cost before
      this flurry in shipping, due to the war, is over. I don't care, Skinner&mdash;provided
      he builds a ship that's big enough to go foreign&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn't that kind,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other kind will do, Skinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to be a schooner yacht&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A yacht&mdash;eighty-five feet over all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty-five grandmothers! Why, what the devil does that boy want of a
      yacht? How much money does he intend to put into her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Ricks; but we can be reasonably certain of one thing;
      Matt Peasley will not build a cheap boat. She'll have a lot of gewgaws and
      gadgets, teak rail, mahogany joiner-work&mdash;at the very least, she'll
      cost him thirty thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; Cappy declared solemnly, &ldquo;he might as well put the money in a
      sack, go down to Clay Street Wharf and throw the money overboard! The
      other night I saw a couple of soldiers having a pleasant time in a
      shooting gallery, but what the president of the Blue Star Navigation
      Company wants with a thirty-thousand-dollar yacht beats my time. Why, he
      has more than thirty good vessels to play with all week, and yet he wants
      a yacht for Sunday! Skinner, my dear boy, that is wild, wanton
      extravagance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dare say Matt thinks he can afford the extravagance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, no man can afford it. Extravagance may reach a point where it
      becomes sinful. And I say it's a crime to put thirty thousand dollars into
      a yacht when the same thirty thousand, invested in a good vessel, will
      yield such tremendous returns. Skinner, my boy, how did you find out about
      this yacht nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking through Matt's desk for a letter I had given him to read,
      and I ran across the plans. Thinking they were Blue Star plans, I looked
      them over; there was a letter from the naval architect attached&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy threw down his pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet,&rdquo; he cried in deep disgust, &ldquo;I thought I
      was going to have a Merry Christmas&mdash;and now it's spoiled! Good Lord,
      Skinner! To think of a man throwing away thirty thousand dollars, not to
      mention the upkeep and interest after he's thrown it away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've just this very day thrown away about thirty thousand dollars you
      didn't have to,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do have to. I've got to keep all my boys happy and satisfied and up on
      their toes, or what the devil would happen to us? They're my partners when
      all is said and done, and how am I going to face my Maker if I don't give
      my partners a square deal? There's a vast difference between justice and
      extravagance. Skinner, you don't suppose Matt's like every other shellback
      of a skipper? Why, he's only twenty-five years old; and if he's got the
      blue-water fever again, after a year ashore, there'll be no standing him
      at thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's got it, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner opined firmly. &ldquo;Did you ever see an
      old sailing skipper that didn't get it? You remember Burns, who had the <i>Sweet
      Alferetta</i>? His father died and left him a million dollars, and five
      years later he came sneaking in here one day, told you he was tired
      clipping coupons and that if you wanted to save his life you'd give him
      back the <i>Sweet Alferetta</i> and a hundred dollars a month to skipper
      her! He sold his interest to his successor for two thousand dollars when
      he fell into the fortune&mdash;and five years later he bought it back for
      three thousand, just so he could have a job again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cappy admitted; &ldquo;they all get the blue-water fever&mdash;after
      they've left blue water. I never knew a sailor yet who wouldn't tell you
      sailoring was a dog's life; but I never knew one who quit and quite
      recovered from the hankering to go back. I think you're right, Skinner.
      This yacht is just a symptom of Matt's disease. He realizes his business
      interests tie him to the beach; but if he has a sailing yacht that he can
      fuss round with on week-ends in the bay, and once in a while make a little
      cruise to Puget Sound or the Gulf of Lower California, he figures he'll
      manage to survive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of yachts,&rdquo; Cappy continued, &ldquo;the case of old Cap'n Cliff Ashley
      suggests a cure for this boy Matt. Cap'n Cliff was a Gloucester fisherman,
      with the smartest little schooner that ever came home from the Grand Banks
      with halibut up to her hatches. He couldn't read or write and he'd never
      learned navigation; but he'd been born with the instincts of a homing
      pigeon, and somehow whenever he pointed his schooner toward Gloucester he
      managed to arrive on schedule; and any time he got a good fair breeze from
      the west, like as not he'd run over to England and sell his catch there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like most of his breed, Cap'n Cliff had to have a fast boat; he had to
      keep her as immaculate as a yacht in order to be happy, and he was never
      so happy as when he'd meet a squadron of the New York Yacht Club out on a
      cruise and sail circles round the flagship with his little old knockabout
      fish schooner. On such occasions old Cap'n Cliff would break out a long
      red burgee with M.O.B.Y.C. in white letters on it. On one of his trips to
      England he hooked up with a big schooner wearing the ensign of the Royal
      Yacht Club and dassed 'em to race with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it happened that the late King Edward was aboard his yacht
      that day, and you know what a sport he was in his palmy days. Cap'n Cliff
      cracked on everything he had in the way of plain sail and, after holding
      the King even for a couple of hours, he put his packet under gaff topsails
      and fisherman's staysail and broke out the balloon jib, bade Edward
      good-bye in the International Code&mdash;and flew! About six hours after
      Cap'n Cliff came to anchor, the King loafed up in his yacht, dropped
      anchor, cleared away his launch, and came over to visit Cap'n Cliff and
      shake hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My dear sir,' says Edward, pointing aloft to the red burgee with
      M.O.B.Y.C. on it, 'pray to what yacht club do you belong?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My own bloomin' yacht club, your majesty,' says Cap'n Cliff; and if he
      hadn't been a Yankee fisherman the King would have knighted him on the
      spot!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that remark, Skinner, my dear boy, clears the atmosphere in the case
      of our own dear Matthew. He shall have his own blooming yacht club, only
      his yacht shall carry cargo and pay her way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I'm going to send him to sea for one voyage, once a year, which
      will break up that blue-water fever and save Matt thirty thousand dollars
      as an initial investment, and about ten thousand a year upkeep and
      interest. All that boy needs to cure him, Skinner, is the old <i>Retriever</i>,
      totally surrounded by horizon and smelling of a combination of tarred
      rope, turpentine, wet canvas, fresh paint, green lumber and the stink of
      the bilge water. Lordy me, Skinner, it puts them to sleep and they wake up
      feeling perfectly bully! Where's the <i>Retriever</i> now, Skinner, and
      who is in charge of her destinies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's due on Puget Sound from the West Coast. Captain Lib Curtis has
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! Well, now, Skinner, you listen to me: The minute he reports
      his arrival you wire Lib to put the old harridan on dry dock and slick her
      up until she looks like four aces and a king, with everybody in the game
      standing pat. Can't have any whiskers on her bottom when Matt takes her
      out, Skinner, because if the boy's to enjoy himself she's got to be able
      to show a clean pair of heels. Then write Lib to wire his resignation and
      give any old reason for it. Have him resign just before the vessel is
      loaded and ready for sea, and tell him to insist on being relieved
      immediately. Of course, Skinner, Matt will get busy right away, looking
      for the right skipper to relieve Captain Curtis&mdash;and about that time
      the president emeritus will shove in his oar and ball things up. Every
      doggoned skipper Matt recommends for the job is going to have his
      application vetoed by Alden P. Ricks, and&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!
      Harumph-h-h!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you stick by me, Skinner. Follow all my leads and don't trump any of
      my aces; and just about the time Matt begins to get good and mad at my
      doggoned interference&mdash;you know, Skinner, my boy, I'm only a
      figurehead&mdash;you cut in and say: 'Well, for heaven's sake! You two
      still squabbling over a skipper for the <i>Retriever?</i> Matt, why don't
      you save the demurrage and take her out yourself&mdash;eh?'&rdquo; And Cappy
      winked knowingly and prodded his general manager in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that plan's kind of poor&mdash;eh, Skinner? I guess it won't work&mdash;eh?
      Particularly when I come right back and say: 'Well, he might as well, for
      all the use he is round this office. Here I go to work and appoint him
      president of the Blue Star and he won't stay in the office and'tend to the
      president's business. Yes, sir! Leaves all that to you and me, Skinner,
      while he degrades himself doing the work of a port captain.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which is quite true, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner affirmed. &ldquo;He will
      not stay in the office&mdash;and he's getting worse. Two-thirds of his
      time is spent round the docks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, two-thirds of his time in 1915 will not be spent round the docks,
      Skinner. Play that bet to win! We're going to have a busy old year in the
      shipping game in 1915, and a busier one in 1916 if that war in Europe
      isn't over by then. A voyage in the <i>Retriever</i> will fix the boy up,
      Skinner, and he'll stick round the office and put over some real business.
      Yachts! Hah! What does a business man want of a yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overlooked one very important detail, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Skinner ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overlook nothing, Skinner&mdash;nothing. His wife shall accompany him
      on the voyage. I shall implant the idea in her head, beginning this very
      night as soon as I get home. I'll just tell her she isn't and never will
      be a true sailor's true love until she takes a voyage with her husband.
      Romantic girl, Florry! She'll about eat that suggestion, feathers and all,
      Skinner. She'll do the real work for us. Always remember, my boy, that an
      ounce of promotion is worth enough perspiration to float the <i>Narcissus</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what shall we do for a port captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've ordered Mike Murphy&mdash;via Matt, of course&mdash;to take a
      vacation under full salary and recover from the wounds he received
      walloping that German crew on the <i>Narcissus</i>. About the time Matt
      leaves in the <i>Retriever</i>, Mike will be ready to go to work again or
      commit murder if we don't give it to him; so we'll slip him a temporary
      appointment as port captain. I'm going to make it permanent some day,
      anyhow. I suppose you've noticed that Mike Murphy has a crush on your
      stenographer; and I don't see how he's going to put anything over if he
      never gets a chance to see the girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really hadn't noticed it, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was a ten-cent piece you'd notice it,&rdquo; Cappy retorted. &ldquo;And now
      that matter is settled, how about this port steward? Is he a grafter? If
      not, raise him five dollars a month. He's been with us only a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon, after Cappy had made the rounds of his office,
      distributing his checks and wishing all hands the merriest of Christmases,
      he paused at last at Mr. Skinner's desk and laid a thousand-dollar check
      thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a peep out of you, Skinner&mdash;not a peep!&rdquo; he cautioned his
      general manager. &ldquo;No thanks due me. You've earned it a thousand times over&mdash;and
      then some. Hum-m! Ahem! Harumph-h-h! By the way, Skinner, my dear boy, I
      forgot to mention to you another little idea that's in the back of my
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about sending Matt to sea for a voyage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. The sea is a wonderful institution, Skinner&mdash;wonderful! It
      promotes health and strength; and&mdash;er&mdash;damn it, Skinner, my dear
      boy, have you ever observed that there isn't a married skipper in our
      employ that hasn't been lucky? Many well-known authorities prescribe a sea
      voyage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy thrust his thumb into Skinner's ribs, winked, bent low, and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too slow, Skinner; too slow. I'm getting old, you know&mdash;I can't wait
      for ever. And if the experiment succeeds&mdash;Skinner, my dear boy,
      you're next! You've been married more than a year now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to comprehend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandson!&rdquo; Cappy whispered. &ldquo;Grandson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Skinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the remarks most frequently heard on California Street was to the
      effect that whenever Cappy Ricks girded up his loins and went after
      something he generally got it. His scheme to get Matt Peasley to sea for
      one voyage, accompanied by Florry, worked as smoothly as a piston; and on
      the fifteenth of January the Peasleys went aboard the <i>Retriever</i> at
      Bellingham and towed out, bound for Manila with a cargo of fir lumber.
      Matt made the run down in sixty-six days, a smart passage, waited a week
      in Manila Bay before he could secure a berth and commence discharging,
      discharged in a week, loaded a cargo of hemp, with a deckload of hardwood
      logs, and was ready for the return trip to San Francisco on April
      twenty-fourth, on which day he towed out past Corregidor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, however, was not with him on the return voyage. Following a
      family conference, it was decided that Florry should return home on the
      mail steamer&mdash;which action Cappy Ricks considered most significant
      when Matt apprised him of it by cable, but failed to state a reason. The
      president emeritus, immediately upon receipt of this information, trotted
      into Mr. Skinner's office and laid Matt Peasley's cablegram on the
      latter's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he piped, rubbing his hands together the
      while, &ldquo;what do you know about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;er&mdash;suspect&mdash;er&mdash;something, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect? Not a bit of it. I know! Neither Florry nor Matt would dream of
      permitting the other to come home alone if there wasn't a third party to
      be considered. Paste that in your hat, Skinner. It isn't done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy was right, for the same steamer that bore his daughter home carried
      also a brief letter from his son-in-law conveying the tidings of great
      joy. The old man was so happy he went into Mr. Skinner's office and struck
      his general manager a terrible blow between the shoulders, after which he
      declared it was a shame that his years and reputation for respectability
      denied him the privilege of chartering a seagoing hack and painting the
      town red!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Retriever</i> crept slowly up the China Sea on the first of the
      southwest monsoon. At that period of the year, however, the monsoon is
      weak and unsteady; and after clearing the northern end of Luzon the <i>Retriever</i>
      kicked round in a belt of light and baffling airs for a week. Then the
      monsoon freshened somewhat and the <i>Retriever</i> once more rolled
      lazily away on her course, with young Matt Peasley humming chanteys on her
      quarter-deck and pondering the mystery that confronts all mankind in their
      first adventure in fatherhood. Would it be a boy or a girl? He was
      expressing to himself for perhaps the thousandth time the hope that it
      would be a boy, when from the poop he saw something he did not relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the ship's cat coming across the deckload toward him, in his yellow
      eyes a singularly pleased expression and in his mouth a singularly large
      rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley stepped below, found an old glove and drew it over his right
      hand, after which he returned to the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Tommy!&rdquo; he called; and pussy came, to be seized by the tail and,
      still holding fast to his prey, cast overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's bad luck to do that to a black cat, sir,&rdquo; the mate informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley's eyes were blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's worse luck still for any mate aboard my ship who neglects to put
      the rat-guards on the lines when the vessel is lying at the dock,&rdquo; he
      growled. &ldquo;You lubberly idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did put the rat-guards on the lines,&rdquo; the mate protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know you did; but I had to remind you of it,&rdquo; Matt replied. &ldquo;You
      didn't get them on in time&mdash;and now the Lord only knows how many rats
      we have aboard. Ordinarily I don't mind rats, but an Oriental rat is
      something to be afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they carry the germs of bubonic plague, you farmer!&rdquo; And Matt
      very carefully removed his glove and cast it overboard after the cat. &ldquo;And
      it's a cold day when you can't find an occasional case of plague in the
      Orient. The cat caught the rat and mauled it round; hence the cat had to
      go, because I never permit in my cabin a cat that has been on intimate
      terms with an Oriental rat. And now I bet I know what's wrong with that
      fo'castle hand that went into the sick bay the day before yesterday. He
      complained of swelling in the glands of his neck and groins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook left the forward deckhouse and came aft over the deckload. At the
      break of the poop he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Peasley,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;Lindstrom is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell everybody to keep away from him,&rdquo; Matt ordered. He turned to the
      mate. &ldquo;Mr. Matson,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;the first duty of a murderer is to get
      rid of the body. Go forward and throw Lindstrom's body overboard; then
      stay forward. If you come aft until I send for you I'll blow your brains
      out!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the <i>Retriever</i> was out from Manila seventy days Cappy Ricks
      remarked to Mr. Skinner that Matt would be breezing in most any day now.
      On the eightieth day he remarked to Mr. Skinner that Matt was coming home
      a deal slower than he had gone out. The efficient Skinner, however, cited
      so many instances of longer passages from Manila to San Francisco that
      Cappy was comforted, although he was not convinced. &ldquo;You make me a
      type-written list of all those vessels and their passages, Skinner,&rdquo; he
      cautioned; &ldquo;and when you can't think of any more authentic cases fake up a
      few. Florry's beginning to worry. She knows now what it means to be a
      sailor's wife, and if that doggoned Matt doesn't report soon 111 know what
      it means to be a sailor's father-in-law. I wish to Jimminy I hadn't sent
      Matt out with the <i>Retriever.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ninety days passed. Cappy commenced to fidget. A hundred days passed, and
      Cappy visited the hydrographic office and spent a long time poring over
      charts of the air currents in the China Sea, along the coast of Asia and
      in the North Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he quavered when he returned to the office; &ldquo;I'm a
      most unhappy old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner forgot for an instant that he was a business man and, with a
      sudden, impulsive movement, he put his long, thin arm round the old man
      and squeezed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you didn't think so much of him, sir,&rdquo; he comforted Cappy, &ldquo;you'd
      worry less. She really will not be overdue until she's out a hundred and
      twenty days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; Cappy piped wearily, &ldquo;don't try to deceive me. I've been in the
      shipping game for forty-odd years, boy. I know it's about six thousand
      miles from San Francisco to Manila, and if a vessel averages ninety miles
      a day she's making a smart passage. Matt made it down in sixty-six days,
      and he ought to come back in sixty, because he has fair winds all the way.
      Skinner, the boy's a month overdue; and if he never shows up&mdash;if he
      stays out much longer&mdash;Florry'll break her heart; and my grandson&mdash;think
      of it, Skinner!&mdash;think of the prenatal effect on the child! Oh,
      Skinner, my dear, dear boy, I want him big and light-hearted and
      sunny-souled like Matt&mdash;and to think this is all my doing&mdash;my
      own daughter! Oh! Oh, Skinner, my heart is breaking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner fled to his own office and did something most un-Skinner-like.
      He blinked away several large bright tears; and while he was blinking them
      the telephone bell rang. Mechanically Mr. Skinner answered. It was Jerry
      Dooley, in charge of the Merchants' Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Skinner,&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;I've got some bad news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The-the-<i>Retriever</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Skinner almost whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I thought I'd tell you first, so you could break it to the old
      man gently. The Grace liner <i>Ecudorian</i> arrived at Victoria this
      morning and reports speaking the <i>Retriever</i> eight hundred miles off
      the coast of Formosa. The vessel was under jib, lower topsail, foretopmast
      staysail, mainsail and spanker. She was flying two flags&mdash;an inverted
      ensign and the yellow quarantine flag. The <i>Ecudorian</i> steamed close
      alongside of her, to windward. Captain Peasley was at the wheel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Mr. Skinner almost sobbed. &ldquo;What was wrong with her, Jerry?
      Hurry up, man! Hurry up! Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was alone on the ship, Mr. Skinner. Bubonic plague! Killed the entire
      crew! Matt was the only man immune, and he's sailing the <i>Retriever</i>
      home alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious Providence! Why didn't the <i>Ecudorian</i> take him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Credit them with offering it,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;He wouldn't come. He
      declined to jeopardize the people aboard the steamer and he wouldn't
      abandon the <i>Retriever</i> with her full cargo; so what could they do?
      They had to sail away without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gently Mr. Skinner broke the news to Cappy Ricks; for, of course, the
      United Press dispatches had carried it to the later afternoon editions and
      it would be useless for Mr. Skinner to attempt to lie kindly. Cappy, with
      bowed head, heard him through; when finally he looked up at Skinner his
      eyes were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite what I expected of him, Skinner,&rdquo; he said dully. &ldquo;And I'd rather
      have him die than dog it! This report from the <i>Ecudorian</i> helps
      some, Skinner. It will do to keep hope alive in my Florry&mdash;and every
      two weeks until the boy is born we'll&mdash;we'll&mdash;Oh, Skinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I'll attend to it. Leave everything to me, Mr. Ricks. I'll have
      wireless reports and telegrams and cablegrams from every port on earth
      telling of ships having spoken the <i>Retriever</i>, with the skipper well
      and hearty, and sending messages of good cheer to his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you won't be&mdash;er&mdash;stingy, Skinner? You'll send out
      the <i>Tillicum</i> to find him and tow him in, won't you? And you'll have
      real telegrams&mdash;spend money, Skinner! I'll have to bring those
      messages home to Florry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, Mr. Ricks. And I'll start right in by slipping fifty dollars
      to each of the waterfront reporters on all the papers. They're good boys,
      Mr. Ricks. I'll tell them why I have to have the service. Mrs. Peasley
      must have our fake reports confirmed in the papers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For work like that the marine reporters should have more money,&rdquo; Cappy
      suggested wearily. His old hand reached out gropingly, closed over Mr.
      Skinner's and held it a moment childishly. &ldquo;You're a very great comfort to
      me, Skinner&mdash;very great indeed! And you'll come home with me
      to-night, won't you, Skinner? I'm a little afraid&mdash;I want you near
      me, Skinner&mdash;in case I can't get away with it to Florry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His dry, dead eyes studied the pattern in the office carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two mates, a cook and ten A. B.'s!&rdquo; he murmured presently. &ldquo;One man, even
      a Matt Peasley, cannot do the work of thirteen men. No, Skinner; it isn't
      done. One man simply cannot sail a barkentine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Skinner was not listening. He was on the long-distance phone
      calling the master of the <i>Tillicum</i>, just about finishing discharge
      of a cargo of nitrate at San Pedro. And presently Cappy heard him
      speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ricks, listen! Grant, of the <i>Tillicum</i>, says Matt would go up
      the China Sea on the southwest monsoon... Yes, captain. You say&mdash;ah,
      yes; quite so... Grant says he'd edge over until he got into the Japan
      Stream, and that would add a knot or two an hour to his speed... Yes,
      Grant. Speak up! ... Grant says, Mr. Ricks, that about the middle of
      September or the first of October Matt would run out of the southwest
      monsoon into the northeast monsoon&mdash;that's it, Grant, isn't it? He'd
      get them about off Formosa, eh?... Yes, Grant. Then he'd run into the
      prevailing westerly winds and run north on a great circle about five
      hundred miles below the Aleutian Islands&mdash;I see, Grant. All right!
      Fill your oil tanks and take an extra supply on deck, head into the North
      Pacific... Yes; use your own judgment, of course. Mine's no good... Yes;
      and bring a lot of disinfectants and a doctor, so it'll be safe to put a
      few men aboard when you find her and put your hawser on her ... Yes,
      Grant. If you find her you'll not have reason to regret it. Good-bye! Good
      luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the <i>Tillicum</i> is on this wild-goose chase, Skinner,&rdquo; Cappy
      said wearily, &ldquo;she is chartered by the Blue Star Navigation Company to
      Alden P. Ricks personally, at the prevailing rates. The stockholders
      mustn't pay for my fancies, Skinner. You'll see to that, won't you?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI

      <i>Excerpt from the log of Captain Matt Peasley relief skipper of the
      American barkentine Retriever; Manila to San Francisco.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      May Third.&mdash;Seaman Olaf Lindstrom died to-day, following an illness
      of thirty-six hours. He was taken with chills and fever on the morning of
      the second, complained of a severe headache and vomited repeatedly.
      Removed him from the forecastle to a spare room in the forward house,
      which on the <i>Retriever</i> has always been used as a sick bay. While
      being supported along the deck he collapsed, and when the mate undressed
      him and put him to bed he complained of soreness in his groins. I examined
      them and found them slightly swollen. Treated him for ague&mdash;calomel,
      salts, quinine and whisky, and one-fortieth-grain strychnine hypodermic
      solution to keep up his heart action when the fever registered one hundred
      and four and higher. He grew steadily worse. Could not find anything in my
      Home Book of Medicine that exactly described his symptoms, and was at a
      loss to diagnose Lindstrom's case until I discovered the ship's cat with a
      rat it had just killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no rats aboard the <i>Retriever</i> when she left San
      Francisco. I recalled that the first night we tied up to the dock in
      Manila a dirty little China Coast tramp lay just ahead of us; and as I
      passed her on my way uptown I saw a rat run down her gangplank. She had
      rat-guards on her mooring lines. We had just tied up to the dock and I
      returned immediately and instructed the mate to be sure to put the
      rat-guards on our mooring lines, and not to use any sort of gangplank.
      When I returned to the vessel later that night I found that the mate had
      neglected to put on the rat-guards and logged him for it. Before we left
      the dock a Chinaman died of bubonic plague aboard that tramp, and the port
      health authorities put the vessel in quarantine immediately and prevented
      further spread of the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw the ship's cat with a rat, therefore, I knew we had some of
      that rotten China Coaster's plague rats aboard. Accordingly threw cat and
      rat overboard just as the cook announced Lindstrom's death. Upon looking
      up the information on plague, I am now convinced we have it aboard&mdash;that
      Linstrom died of it. First Mate Olaf Matson wrapped himself in my old
      bathrobe, gloved his hands and threw Lindstrom's body overboard, following
      it with the gloves and bathrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, in a measure, prepared for plague. When I learned we had lain close
      to a vessel with a case of plague aboard I laid in some plague medicine,
      on general principles and just to have an anchor out to windward. At the
      English drug store on the Escolta I bought a tiny bottle of Yersin's
      Antipest Serum and another of Haffkine's Prophylactic Fluid. It was all
      they had on hand and it wasn't much; but&mdash;it is enough to save me&mdash;and
      I intend to be saved if possible. I cannot afford to die now. I do not
      know how old the Haffkine's Fluid is; and the older it is, the longer it
      takes to render one immune. The antipest serum will render me immune
      immediately, but the duration of the immunity thus granted lasts, at the
      most, only fifteen days. I must, therefore, first take a hypodermic
      injection of antipest serum to render me immune immediately and the next
      day follow with an injection of Haffkine's Fluid, which gives permanent
      immunity, but not for a week or longer when used alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is this devilish thing about it to be considered, however: I may at
      this moment be inoculated with plague, for the period of incubation is
      from three to seven days&mdash;and I've fondled that cat every day since
      we left Manila. If I am already infected and do not know it, and while in
      that condition take an injection of the antipest serum, the book says the
      serum will immediately bring on a fatal and virulent attack of the plague!
      On the other hand, if I am not inoculated and take the antipest serum I am
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question before the house, therefore, is: Shall I take it or shall I
      not? And if I do take it shall I be saving my life or committing suicide?
      I am like the fellow in the story who was forced to drink from one of two
      glasses of wine. He knew one of them contained poison, but he didn't know
      which one it was! I shall make my will and flip a coin to decide the
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Fourth.&mdash;Two a.m. Mate reports another sick man in the
      forecastle. Wish I had some formaldehyde gas. Have told mate to sprinkle
      chloride of lime in Lindstrom's bunk and to dust the walls and floors of
      the forecastle and sick bay with it. That is the only disinfectant I have
      aboard in quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight I flipped the coin&mdash;heads I'd take it; tails I wouldn't.
      The coin fell heads&mdash;and I took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four a.m.&mdash;Mustered the crew and gave them a lecture on bubonic
      plague. I have sufficient antipest serum for four men. After explaining
      that it was Hobson's choice, I asked the men to draw matches, held in the
      hand of the first mate, to see who should be the lucky ones. They all
      decided to take a chance and go without it, with the exception of two
      seamen and the mates, who, learning that I had taken it, decided to follow
      suit. Accordingly I inoculated them with the antipest serum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five p.m.&mdash;Inoculated myself with Haffkine's Fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven-thirty.&mdash;Seaman Ross died. Mr. Matson threw the body overboard.
      No services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight.&mdash;Mr. Matson is down with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Fifth.&mdash;Mr. Matson very ill and delirious. Cook moping round like
      a drunken man; complains of severe headache. Wind blowing lightly from
      south-west. Everything set. Inoculated second mate and the two seamen with
      Haffkine's.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Sixth.&mdash;Mr. Matson died at noon today. Cook down with it; also
      another seaman, and Mr. Eccles, the second mate. Have altered ship's
      course and am running for Hongkong. Winds light and baffling. Have not
      made thirty miles today. Calm at midnight. Mr. Eccles died just as the
      watches were being changed. I now feel that I have escaped; so examined
      Mr. Eccles' body. He went so fast I am curious. No swelling of the glands
      at all. Am inclined to think his was pneumonic or septicaemic. Threw him
      overboard myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Seventh.&mdash;Light and baffling airs all day; monsoon blowing in
      weak puffs. Another seaman ill. So ends this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Eighth.&mdash;Cook died at noon. No buboes on him either. He turned
      kind of black. I was chief undertaker. No airs to speak of. Ship barely
      making steerage way. So ends this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Ninth.&mdash;Seaman Peterson died early this morning. Do not know
      exact hour. Found him dead in his berth. Another funeral; no services.
      Monsoon freshening. Made forty-eight miles today. Two more seamen on sick
      report; and, to add to my worries, they are the very two I inoculated with
      the antipest serum and Haffkine's. Is this stuff worthless?
    </p>
    <p>
      May Tenth.&mdash;Seamen Halloran and Kaiser died within an hour of each
      other this evening&mdash;Halloran at nine-thirty and Kaiser at
      ten-eighteen. Put both bodies overboard immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have four seamen left, and am doing the cooking, navigating, nursing and
      undertaking. Wind freshening hourly. Made seventy-two miles today. Glad
      Florry and Cappy Ricks cannot see me now, although, for some fool reason,
      I have a notion I shall see them again. If I were going to get plague it
      would have developed before now. I feel quite safe, but most unhappy and
      worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight.&mdash;Seaman Anderson down with it. Jumped overboard to save me
      the bother of throwing him overboard about the day after to-morrow, which
      is a courtesy I did not expect of Anderson. I am obliged to him. I am
      exhausted and so are my three remaining seamen. We cannot handle the
      canvas now, so have taken in the foresail, royals, and topgallant sails,
      hauled down the flying jib and got the gaff topsail off her, leaving her
      under the jib, fore-topmast staysail, upper and lower fore-topsails,
      main-topmast staysail, mainsail and spanker. Hove her to and turned in.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Eleventh.&mdash;After a horrible breakfast, which I cooked, got under
      way again. Monsoon blowing nicely, but under the small amount of canvas I
      am forced to carry cannot make more than six miles an hour. Have decided
      not to run to Hongkong. If I am to lose my three remaining seamen I shall
      have lost them long before I sight land, and the tug or steamer that hooks
      on to me off Hongkong will stick me with a terrific salvage bill. If I'm
      going to be stuck I prefer to be stuck closer to home, and if I manage to
      keep these three men the four of us can sail her home. I'll take a chance
      and run up the coast of Asia with the Japan Stream until I reach the
      northeast monsoon. I'm certain to be spoken and can send word to Florry.
      In a pinch, at this season of the year, I can sail her home alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Fifteenth.&mdash;I am alone on the ship. Into the Japan Stream,
      monsoon blowing the sweetest it ever blew. Lucky thing for me I had the
      forethought to trim her down; otherwise I should have had to cut away a
      lot of canvas. And how Cappy Ricks would scream at the sail bill later on!
      We were hove to overnight when Borden and Jacobsen died, on the
      thirteenth. McBain complained of a headache and vertigo on the morning of
      the fourteenth; so I laid to until he died, last night. I was not with him
      when he passed. What good would it have done? I had breakfast; and after
      breakfast I found him in his berth, dead. I tossed him overboard, and
      every last rag of clothing, dunnage and blankets aboard, with the
      exception of those in my own cabin. Then I burned sulphur in the
      fore-castle, the galley, the cook's room and the stateroom formerly
      occupied by the mates, closed the doors, and hoped for the best. Slept a
      lot that day and night; and at eight this morning slacked off my spanker
      and main sheets, checked in my foreyard and topsail by taking the the
      braces to the donkey engine, and was off for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have established my commissary in the lee of the wheel box. Set up a small
      kerosene stove I found in the storeroom, and get along nicely. It is quite
      an art to fry eggs with one hand and steady the wheel with the other, but
      I managed it three times today. To-morrow I will cook enough at breakfast
      to last me for luncheon and supper; hence will only have to heat some
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logged fifty-one miles by eight o'clock; then lashed the wheel and let her
      take care of herself while I got steam up in the donkey and hauled in my
      spanker and mainsail; then I slacked off my foreyard and topsail yards,
      hove her to on the port tack, hung three red lights on the forestay to
      show she wasn't under command, set my alarm clock and turned in. I have to
      smile at the ease with which one man&mdash;provided he is a sizable man
      and able to stand strain&mdash;can sail a barkentine before the wind in
      fair weather. I am not worried. I am not going to have bubonic plague. It
      is horribly lonely, but I am due for fair winds&mdash;and I should worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if I should get a blow and have to take the lower topsail off her, I
      can lower the yard by the topsail halyards until it rests on the cap; then
      I'll skip aloft and run a knife along the head of the topsail and let it
      whip to glory. After that it may blow and be damned! All the clothes the
      old girl is wearing now will never take the sticks out of her. I've
      trimmed her down to jib, lower topsail, fore-topmast staysail, mainsail
      and spanker. Wish I dared carry the foresail. However, I must play safe.
      It is awful, though, to be in a ship as fast as the <i>Retriever</i> and
      have to crawl the way I'm crawling. Crawl all day and sleep all night!
      Well, sometimes I can crawl all day and night and sleep half a day. We
      shall see. I used to be able to stand considerable before I hit the beach
      and got soft. The necessity for firing the donkey every night would soon
      exhaust my fuel supply; but I have a deck-load of hardwood logs!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four months had passed since the <i>Ecudorian</i> had spoken Matt Peasley
      off the coast of Formosa; during that period no further news had been
      received in Cappy Ricks' office, although the diligent Skinner, aided and
      abetted by the waterfront reporters, managed to have a piece of cheering
      information for Florry about every two weeks. And, in order to forestall
      any possibility of some garrulous girl friend, with a male relative in the
      shipping business, &ldquo;spilling the beans,&rdquo; as Cappy expressed it, the old
      man had taken a house in the country, and came to the office only twice a
      week to mourn for his lost Matthew and glean what little comfort he could
      from the empty words of hope Mr. Skinner dispensed so lavishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can only keep Florry buoyed up with hope until the baby comes!&rdquo;
       Cappy would groan. &ldquo;She's worried; but, strange to say, Skinner, she
      hasn't the slightest idea he's in any danger. Those fake cablegrams and
      reports of ships speaking Matt&mdash;each time closer to home&mdash;have
      done the trick, Skinner. Of course the boy's dead, and I killed him; but
      Florry&mdash;well, she took a trip on the <i>Retriever</i> and knows how
      safe she is, and I've had a lot of old sailing skippers down to visit me,
      and primed them to tell her just how they would get away with such a
      proposition as Matt's&mdash;and how easy it would be. Besides, she knows
      Matt had some plague prophylactic aboard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I've told her she mustn't show the white feather&mdash;for your
      sake,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner interrupted; &ldquo;and I think she's sensible enough to know
      she mustn't permit herself to show it&mdash;for the baby's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy bowed his head and shook like a hooked fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the baby's two weeks old I'll tell her,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;Oh, Skinner,
      Skinner, my dear boy, this is going to kill me! I won't last long now,
      Skinner. All my fault! I had to go butting in. That girl's heart is
      breaking with anxiety. When she comes down to breakfast, Skinner, I can
      see she's been crying all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; Mr. Skinner murmured. &ldquo;Horrible! We can only hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the twelfth of September Florry's baby was born. It was a boy, and a
      bouncing boy at that; and Cappy Ricks forgot for the moment he had
      rendered that baby fatherless, and came up to the city to report the news
      to Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he announced with just a touch of his
      old-time jauntiness, &ldquo;little Matthew just arrived! Everything lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner was about to formulate suitable phrases of congratulation when
      the telephone bell rang. It was Jerry Dooley up at the Merchants'
      Exchange; and he was all excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Skinner,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The <i>Retriever</i> is passing in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Mr. Skinner shrieked. &ldquo;It isn't possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is! She's coming in the Gate now&mdash;she's right under the lookout's
      telescope; and there's only one man on deck&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner turned to Cappy Ricks, put his arms round him and jerked the
      old man from one end of the office to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's safe, he's safe, he's safe, he's safe!&rdquo; he howled indecorously.
      &ldquo;Matt's sailing her in. He's sailing her in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;Be quiet! Is she sailing in or towing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's sailing in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks slumped down in his chair, his arms hanging weakly at his
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Skinner,&rdquo; he barely whispered, &ldquo;Matt's alive, after all. Nobody else
      would have the consummate crust to sail her in but him. Any other skipper
      under heaven would have hove to off the lightship and sent in word by the
      pilot boat to send out a tug. Oh, Lord, I thank Thee! I'm a wicked,
      foolish, bone-headed old man; but Lord, I do thank Thee&mdash;I do,
      indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Cappy Ricks and Mr. Skinner, in a fast motorboat, came
      flying up the bay and caught sight of the <i>Retriever</i> loafing lazily
      past Fort Mason. On she came, with a tiny bone in her teeth; and suddenly,
      as Cappy peered ahead through the spray that flew in over the bows of the
      launch and drenched him to the skin, the <i>Retriever's</i> mainsail was
      lowered rapidly. The vessel was falling off by the time the mainsail was
      down and Cappy and Mr. Skinner saw Matt run aft, steady the wheel and
      bring the vessel up on the wind again. She was now under spanker and the
      headsails. Matt lashed the wheel and again ran forward, pausing at the
      main-topmast-staysail halyards to cast them off and permit the sail to
      come down by the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      On to the topgallant forecastle Matt Peasley leaped, praising his Maker
      for patent anchors on the <i>Retriever</i>. With a hammer he knocked out
      the stopper; the starboard anchor dropped and the red rust flew from her
      hawsepipe as the anchor chain screamed through it. With his hand on the
      compressor of the windlass, Matt Peasley snubbed her gently to the
      forty-five fathom shackle, cast off his jib halyards to let the jib slide
      down the stay by its own weight, raced aft, and gently lowered the spanker
      as the American barkentine <i>Retriever</i>, with the yellow flag flying
      at the fore, swung gently to anchor on the quarantine grounds, two hundred
      and twenty-one days from Manila.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks turned to his general manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty work, Skinner!&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I guess there's nothing wrong
      with that boy's health. Damn! The quarantine boat will beat us to it!
      Matt's throwing the Jacob's ladder over the side for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't board her until she passes quarantine&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Skinner began;
      but Cappy silenced him with a terrible look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word can't, Skinner, was eliminated from my vocabulary some fifty
      years ago. We can&mdash;and I will! You needn't; but I've simply got to!
      Hey, you!&rdquo;&mdash;to the launchman&mdash;&ldquo;kick her wide open and show some
      speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite the warning cries from the quarantine officers in the health boat,
      the launch ran in along the <i>Retriever's</i> side; Cappy Ricks grasped
      the Jacob's ladder as the launch rasped by and climbed up with an agility
      that caused Mr. Skinner to marvel. As his silk hat appeared over the <i>Retriever's</i>
      rail a wind-bitten, bewhiskered, gaunt, hungry-looking semi-savage reached
      down, grasped him under the arms, snaked him inboard and hugged him to his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence for a minute, while Cappy Ricks' thin old shoulders shook and
      heaved as from some internal spasm, and Matt Peasley's big brown hand
      patted Cappy's back. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father-in-law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From somewhere in Matt Peasley's whiskers Cappy's voice came plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not father-in-law, sonny. New title&mdash;this morning&mdash;six o'clock&mdash;nine&mdash;pounds&mdash;grandfather!
      Eh? Yes; grandfather! Grandpa Ricks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy or girl?&rdquo; Matt Peasley roared, and shook the newly-elected
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy! Florry&mdash;fine&mdash;never lost hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A port health officer came over the rail. He shook an admonitory finger at
      Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, you! Old man, you're under arrest&mdash;that is, you're in
      quarantine, and you'll have to stay aboard this ship until she's
      fumigated. Yes; and we'll fumigate you, too. Whadje mean by coming aboard
      ahead of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy,&rdquo; Matt Peasley said, &ldquo;tell that person to go chase himself! Why,
      there hasn't been any plague aboard the ship in nearly five months!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy looked up and wiped the tears of joy out of his whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; he cackled. &ldquo;Infernal young scoundrel! What do you mean by
      risking my <i>Retriever</i>, sailing her through the Gate with a crew of
      one man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a look at me!&rdquo; Matt laughed. &ldquo;I'm all hands! And didn't I prove I'm
      enough men to handle her? The pilots wouldn't board me, and by sailing her
      in myself I saved pilotage and salvage claims. I lost the lower topsail
      and the consignees are going to find a shortage in those hardwood logs;
      but that's all&mdash;except that I haven't had a decent meal in God knows
      when. Say, Cappy, what does he look like? A Peasley or a Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; Cappy chirped diplomatically. &ldquo;Matt, are you all over the
      blue-water fever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No more relief jobs for me. I've had plenty,
      although it might have been worse. It was lonely and sometimes I thought I
      was going crazy. Used to talk out loud to myself! I had some awful
      weather; but I just tucked her head under her wing and let her roll, and
      after I ran into the northeast monsoon, and later into the westerly winds,
      I had it easier and got more rest. You know, Cappy, when a ship is sailing
      on the wind, if you lash her helm a little bit below amidships she'll
      steer herself. Slow work, but&mdash;I got here; and, now that I'm here,
      I'm going to stay here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Cappy,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I've just got to have something with sails
      to play with; but no more offshore sailing in mine&mdash;that is&mdash;well,
      I'm going to stay home for a long time&mdash;after a while, maybe&mdash;and
      meantime I'm going to build a little schooner yacht&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of Mike, do!&rdquo; Cappy pleaded. &ldquo;I'll be stuck in quarantine
      with you for a couple of days and we'll kill time drawing up a rough set
      of plans. And when that schooner yacht is ready, Matt, I'll tell you what
      I want you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send the bill to grandpa, Matthew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I hadn't been a case-hardened old fool I'd have cheered you on when
      you wanted to build that schooner yacht last year. I'd have saved myself a
      world of grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed his hand gently on Matt's shoulder and his face was ineffably
      sad as he continued: &ldquo;Of course, with you away and your fate undecided, as
      it were, Matt, that infernal Skinner wasn't worth two hoots in a hollow.
      Why, the boy flopped around the office like a rooster with its head off,
      and as a result I've had to come out of my retirement and keep an eye on
      things. Thank God, I can let go now. Really, Matt, you have no idea how I
      long to separate myself from the hurly-burly of California street. What I
      want is peace and seclusion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have my share of that commodity for the remainder of my natural
      life,&rdquo; Matt laughed happily, &ldquo;I want noise and people. I want screaming
      and yelling and fighting and risks and profits and losses and liars and
      scoundrels and honest men all inextricably mixed.&rdquo; He tossed his great
      sun-tanned arms above his head. &ldquo;Lord, I want Life,&rdquo; he half shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy sighed. These young pups! When they grow to see life as old dogs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matt, all I've got to say is that the first man that butts into my
      private office and starts unloading a cargo of grief on me, is going to
      get busted between the eyes with a paper weight. I'm through with grief
      and woe. I don't give a hoot what happens to the world or anybody in it. I
      want peace and a rest. I can afford it and wouldn't I be a first-class
      idiot not to take it while the taking is good, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more mixing in the shipping end, eh?&rdquo; Matt asked hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy raised his right hand solemnly. &ldquo;Never again, Matt. I'm through with
      ships and sailors and cargoes and the whole cussed Blue Star fleet can
      sink and be damned to it, but I'll not lift a hand to save it. I'm
      THROUGH.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      ALAS! Man proposes, but God disposes. Cappy had smoked his post-prandial
      cigar next day and was in the midst of his mid-afternoon siesta, when the
      buzzer on his desk waked him with its insistent buzzing. He reached for
      the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he reproved his private exchange operator, &ldquo;how often have I
      told you not to disturb me between two and three o'clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you wouldn't mind being disturbed this afternoon, Mr. Ricks. Your
      old friend Mr. Gurney, of New York, is calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Joe Gurney? By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet! Show him in.&rdquo; Cappy was at
      the door to meet his visitor when the latter entered. Mr Joseph Gurney,
      senior partner of the firm of Gurney &amp; Harlan, was, like Cappy Ricks,
      a shiping man and a Down-Easter. He and Cappy Ricks had been a boyhood
      friends in Thomaston, Main, and Gurney &amp; Harlan were the agents and
      controlling owners of the Red Funnel line plying between New York and
      ports on the West Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, you doddering old pirate?&rdquo; cried Cappy Ricks affectionately.
      &ldquo;Come in and rest your hands and feet. I'm tremendously glad to see you.
      When did you drift into down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with Gurney and steered him toward a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes ago, Alden, my boy. Delighted to see you again, and
      particularly pleased to see how carelessly you carry your years. I'm three
      months younger than you&mdash;and I feel like the last rose of summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look it, Joe. Take a leaf out of my book and let the young fellows
      'tend to business for you. Don't let worry ride over you in the shank of
      your old age, my boy. I never do. Haven't paid a bit of attention to
      business in the last ten years, and that's why at my age I'm looking so
      fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll live to be a hundred, Alden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I'm going to live while I have the time. I never
      expect to be a walking corpse just stalling round in an effort to defer
      settlement with the undertaker, and I won't be a dead one until the
      neighbors hear a quartet singing Lead Kindly Light out at my house&mdash;Joe
      you look worried. Anything gone wrong with you, old friend? Need some
      money? Have you married a young wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Joey,&rdquo; Gurney confessed miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? My godson, little Joey Gurney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's big Joey Gurney now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a fine boy, Joe&mdash;no thanks to you. His mother's influence
      was strong enough to counteract any impulses for crime he might have
      inherited from his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurney smiled sadly at Cappy Ricks' badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine boy, Alden, but&mdash;he's only a boy, and I'm afraid he's
      going to make hash of his young life before it's fairly started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Booze?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then where did he first meet this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe Gurney, Senior, hitched his chair close to his friend's and laid an
      impressive hand on Cappy's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden,&rdquo; he said feelingly, &ldquo;you and I have been friends, man and boy, for
      about sixty-five years. I believe we were five years old when we robbed
      Deacon Follansbee's beehive and got stung to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we've both been getting stung more or less ever since, only
      somehow we still manage to recover and be none the worse for the
      experience. At least, Joe, we learned about bees. When it comes to boys,
      however, I've still got my experience coming. My little chap died when he
      was twelve, you know. I've never quite gotten over his loss; in fact, Joe,
      I was dreaming of him a minute ago when you called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had him long enough, Alden, to realize how I feel about Joey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy nodded. &ldquo;Let's see,&rdquo; he answered, reflectively pulling his whiskers,
      &ldquo;Joey must be about twenty-four years old now, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four last Tuesday; and at twenty-five he comes into his mother's
      fortune. I've managed his little nest egg pretty well, Alden; invested it
      all in the vessel property of Gurney &amp; Harlan, and since the war
      started I've swelled what originally was a quarter of a million to about a
      million and a half. His stock in the Red Funnel Line is worth a million at
      the very least, and the remaining half million is represented by cold cash
      in bank and bonds that can be converted into cash overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! Harumph-h-h! Quite a fortune for a youth of a twenty-five to be
      intrusted with. I'll bet somebody will take it away from him before he's
      thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a safe bet, Alden. He has a candidate for his money on his trail
      right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he doesn't realize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden, he's only twenty-four years old. What does a boy know at
      twenty-four?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, you and I had accumulated a heap of experience and hard knocks
      at that age, and I seem to remember we each had a little money we'd
      managed to save here and there. I don't agree with you at all on this
      twenty-four-year-old excuse. My son-in-law, Matt Peasley&mdash;you
      remember the Peasleys of Thomaston; Matt's a nephew of Ethan, who was lost
      off the main yard of the <i>Martha Peasley</i>&mdash;was holding a
      master's ticket for sail, any ocean and any tonnage, before he was
      twenty-one. He's not much older than your Joey right now, but,
      nevertheless, he's president of the Blue Star Navigation Company and worth
      a million and a half, every dollar of which he has made by his own energy
      and ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, Alden, there are exceptions to every rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you raise 'em right and you've got the right kind of stock to work
      on and the boy is healthy and normal. Now I know your Joey comes from the
      right stock; I know his mother raised him right until he was sixteen when
      the good Lord took her away from you both; and I know he is healthy and
      normal. Hasn't he proved that by falling in love? The only conclusion I
      can draw, therefore, is that you've made a monkey out of him, Joe Gurney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have, Alden; perhaps I have,&rdquo; Gurney replied sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No 'perhaps' about it. I know you have. You sent him to college and gave
      him ten thousand dollars a year to spend. If you wanted to give him a fine
      education and turn out a man and a gentleman you might have gotten him
      into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he would have learned something
      of ships and graduated with a master's ticket; after serving a few years
      and getting the corners knocked off him he could have resigned and you
      would have had a sane, dependable man to sit in at your desk when you're
      gone. By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, Joe Gurney, you make me sick! You're
      like every other damphool American father who accumulates a few million
      dollars in excess of his legitimate needs and then gets all puffed up with
      the notion he's got to give his son all the so-called advantages his own
      parents were too poor to afford him&mdash;or too sensible. The result is
      you turn out an undeveloped or over-developed boob, too proud to work and
      not able to take a real man's place in the world because he hasn't been
      taught how. And in the course of time he marries a female boob who has
      been raised according to the same general specifications, and nine times
      out of ten she's too refined to be bothered with a family. And presently
      there's a trip out to Reno and the little squib in the paper and&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!
      Drat your picture, Joe, you're the responsible party. You created a
      ten-thousand-dollar-a-year parasite on the body politic while your boy was
      still in his teens, and now you want to know what the devil to do about
      it, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly what I want to know, Alden,&rdquo; Gurney confessed miserably,
      &ldquo;and I've crossed the continent to get your advice. I haven't very many
      real friends&mdash;the kind I can open my heart to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, Joe. Enough of vain repining. Now then, old friend, let's get
      to the bottom of this thing and see if we can't buy this wreck in from the
      underwriters, salvage it and put it in commission again. Never say die,
      Joe! Where there's a will there's a lawsuit or a heartache&mdash;particularly
      if the estate makes it worth while. Now then, Joe, you must realize that
      it's the fashion nowadays, when a fellow has to consult a specialist, to
      give his personal and family history for three generations back before
      receiving treatment. So if I am to diagnose Joey's case I'll have to have
      a history of Joey. Now then! He graduated from college at the age of
      twenty-two did he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't graduate, Alden. He was requested to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! I didn't know that. What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General uselessness and animal spirits, I suppose. It wasn't anything
      dishonorable. The main contributory cause was an alleged poem lampooning
      some individual they called Prexy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! And since leaving college what has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had him in my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, answer my question. I know you've had him in your office. But what
      has he done? Has he earned his salary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid he hasn't, Alden. Somehow golf and tennis and week-end parties
      and yachting and big-game hunting in Alaska and tarpon fishing in Florida
      sort of interfere with business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that isn't much of a crime, Joe. I never had time to do those
      highly enjoyable things and I couldn't afford them. When I could afford
      them and had time to do them I was too old. You say the boy is fond of
      yachting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's his greatest hobby. In his taste for salt water he at least
      resembles his ancestors. The Gurneys were all sailors and shipping men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good yachtsman, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a schooner that's a hundred and six feet over all and he seems to
      win pretty regularly with her. I never knew him to get worse than second
      place in all the races he has entered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks murmured sadly. &ldquo;A noble ambition absolutely
      misdirected. He would have been a skipper and, lastly, a good shipping man
      if you had only managed him like a sensible father should. Now about this
      girl he's in love with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That happened about three months ago. He met her at one of those
      roof-garden, midnight cabaret, turkey-trot palaces in New York&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I always take in the sights when I go to New York, but the
      last time I was at that one up near Fifty-fourth Street the noise bothered
      me. And the show was very poor; in fact, after seeing it I made up my mind
      I was off cabaret stuff for keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ancient scalawag! What were you doing in a place like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing life as it ought not to be, of course. Your boy Joey took me up
      there, by the way. In-fer-nal young scoundrel! He showed me the town and
      we had quite a time together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe Gurney's old eyes popped with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went batting round with my Joey&mdash;an old ruin like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? We behaved ourselves, and besides I always trot a heat with the
      young fellows whenever I get a chance. It keeps me young. I enjoyed Joey a
      heap, although I could see he was a jolly young jackass. Moreover, I'm his
      godfather, and I guess it was all right for me to tag along and see to it
      that my godson didn't get into deep water close to the shore, wasn't it?
      Don't you ever step out with Joey and get your nose wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks smiled wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had a son I'd pal up with him,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I'd want to get out
      with him and raise a little dignified hell once in a while, just to be a
      human being and keep him from being a mollycoddle. Ahem! Harumph. So he
      flagged this damsel in the leg show, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe Gurney nodded miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given her the once over?&rdquo; Cappy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went up there one night. I was afraid somebody would see me, so I
      took along Joey's aunt, Matilda. We saw the young woman. She does a dance
      specialty&mdash;an alleged Hawaiian hula-hula. It's fake from start to
      finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You show a guilty technical knowledge of the hula, Joe,&rdquo; Cappy reminded
      him. &ldquo;But passing that, what's the latest report on the situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible, Alden, horrible!&rdquo; replied Joe Gurney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful, Joe, careful! Many a wheat-straw skirt and sharks'-teeth
      necklace may conceal a pure and honest heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's been married twice and divorced once, to begin with, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a-plenty, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she has just completed her contract in the show and gone out to Reno
      to acquire a six months' residence in order to get rid of husband number
      two so she can take on Joey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it out&mdash;by asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told Joey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurney nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had one of his young friends, whom I can trust, tip him off in
      confidence. The news didn't make any difference to Joey. He asked her
      about it, and she explained it all away to his entire satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say. And you haven't given any indication to your son that you're
      on to him and his love affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought best to pretend ignorance, pending my arrival at a solution of
      the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therein you showed a gleam of real intelligence. Having humored your boy
      all his life you could not expect to cross him in his first love affair
      and get away with it. No, sir-ree! The thing to do is to put the skids
      under Joey and his lady love before they know you know it. Tell me more
      about her, however, before I begin making skids and skid grease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is thirty-one years old&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks threw up both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, O my countrymen!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has two children&mdash;one by her first husband and one by her
      second. They're living with her mother. She supports them from the
      proceeds of her hula dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Score a white mark for her, Joe. Is she a good looker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brunette, Alden, and Joey's Aunt Matilda admitted against her will that
      she was a beauty. My lawyer tells me, however, that she hasn't an ounce of
      brains, and proclaims the fact by laughing loudly when there is nothing
      particularly worth laughing at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine you've had a detective agency investigating her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. She has little education and no refinement; her people are very
      ordinary. Her father is a whitewing in Philadelphia and is separated from
      her mother, who keeps a boarding house in Muncie, Indiana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, Joe, she won't do for your daughter-in-law,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks
      opined slowly. &ldquo;But don't worry, my boy. You've come all the way from New
      York to confide in me and get my advice, and somehow I have a sneaking
      notion you've come to the right shop. If there's anybody calculated to put
      a crimp in love's young dream, I'm that individual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Joey and you were good friends, and besides, you're his godfather.
      He thinks a lot of you, Alden, and I kind of thought maybe you might come
      East with me, see the boy, get him to confide in you and&mdash;er&mdash;sort
      of advise him in the way he should go. I'm&mdash;er&mdash;well, Alden, I'm
      afraid I feel too badly about this to talk to Joey. I might lose my
      temper, and besides&mdash;besides, he's all I have and he reminds me so
      much of his mother that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand, Joe. Leave it to me and I'll advise with him.
      Yes, I will&mdash;with an ax handle! And I'll go East with you and tie
      knots in his tail&mdash;only he won't know anything about it. It may cost
      you a little money, but I assume expense is no object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be cheap at a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where that boy and your money are concerned you're such an ass, Joe, I'm
      almost tempted to charge you a million extra for the operation. However,
      considering Deacon Follansbee's beehive, and Joey's mother and my godson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Joe Gurney took Cappy Ricks' hand in both of his, that trembled so
      with age and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Alden,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I knew you wouldn't fail me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a long time after old Joe Gurney had terminated his visit Cappy Ricks
      sat in the position which with him always denoted intense mental
      concentration. He had sunk low in his swivel chair and swung his old legs
      to the top of his desk; his head was bowed on his breast and his eyes were
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he started as if snake-bitten, sat up at his desk and reached for
      the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me the West Coast Trading Company,&rdquo; he ordered the private exchange
      operator, &ldquo;and tell Mr. J. Augustus Redell I want to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell answered presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gus, my dear young friend,&rdquo; Cappy began briskly, &ldquo;I want you to do me a
      favor, and in so doing I think you'll find you are going to perform one
      for yourself also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, Cappy. Consider it done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my boy, but this particular favor isn't done quite so quickly.
      I want you to tell that Peruvian partner of yours, Live Wire Luiz Almeida
      to dig up a specification for a cargo of fir to be discharged on lighters
      at some open roadstead on the West Coast, and the more open the port and
      the more difficult it is to discharge there; and the harder it is to get
      any sane shipowner to charter a vessel to deliver a cargo there, the
      better I'll be pleased. Surely, Gus, you must have a customer down on the
      West Coast in some such port as I describe, who is actually watering at
      the mouth for a cargo of lumber and is unable to place it with a mill that
      will guarantee delivery? Look into the matter, Augustus, and see what you
      can do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to furnish such a cargo from one of the Ricks Lumber &amp;
      Logging Company's northern mills and freight it in one of your Blue Star
      Navigation Company vessels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't want to do it,&rdquo; Cappy replied; &ldquo;but in this particular case
      the acceptance of such a cargo and the freighting of it via a Blue Star
      windjammer, even though the usual demurrage at such discharging ports will
      cause the vessel a loss, is a consummation devoutly to be wished.
      Ordinarily, if you made such a proposition to me I'd call in the boys from
      the general office and tell them to throw you out, but&mdash;well, in this
      case I'm willing to stand the loss, Augustus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are&mdash;not. Somebody else will recompense you for any loss,
      Cappy Ricks, never fear. Do you want the West Coast Trading Company to
      give you a bonus for accepting our order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy. I'll make Skinner sell you the lumber at the regular base
      price at the mill, plus insurance and freight to point of discharge. And I
      won't stick you too deep on the freight, even in wartime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something wrong with you this morning, Cappy,&rdquo; Redell declared,
      highly mystified. &ldquo;You're too obliging. However, I'm not to be outgamed. I
      have a specification for a cargo of half a million feet for delivery at
      Sobre Vista, Peru; I've been trying for a month to place the order and
      nobody will accept it because nobody wants to guarantee delivery. On the
      other hand, the purchasers have been unable to get any ship owner to
      charter them a vessel to go to Sobre Vista without a guaranty of a
      perfectly prohibitive rate of demurrage per diem; consequently I had just
      about abandoned my efforts to place the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine business, Gus. And is Sobre Vista a rotten port at which to
      discharge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's vile, Cappy. It's an open roadstead and the vessel lies off-shore
      and discharges into lighters. About four days a week the surf is so high
      the lighters cannot lie alongside the ship or be run up on the beach
      without being ruined, and to complicate the situation they only have two
      or three lighters at the port. Labor is scarce, too, and the few <i>cargadores</i>
      a skipper can hire have a habit of working two days and staying drunk for
      the remainder of the week on the proceeds of those two days of labor. So
      you can see for yourself that discharge in Sobre Vista is very hard on the
      skipper's nerves, and that if he can work two days a week he's in luck.
      And when we deduct from those two days all the national holidays and holy
      days and saints' feast days that have to be duly celebrated, not to
      mention the three hundred and sixty-five days in the year the populace
      doesn't feel like exerting itself&mdash;well, Cappy, I couldn't give you
      anything worse than Sobre Vista if you paid me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the good Lord bless you, Augustus! Come down and do business with
      Skinner on the cargo. Get him to quote you a price f.o.b. ship's tackles
      at the mill dock and tell him you'll furnish the tonnage when the cargo is
      ready for delivery. There's no sense in worrying poor Skinner until his
      worries are due, and when I send a Blue Star schooner to load your cargo
      for Sobre Vista I'm going to have to fight him and my son-in-law, Matt
      Peasley. But leave it to me, Gus. I'll guarantee the tonnage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly wonderful,&rdquo; the grateful Redell observed. &ldquo;Thank you,
      Cappy. What I'll do to those Peruvian customers of mine on price will be a
      shame and a disgrace. Are you going to stick me for any demurrage on the
      vessel, Cappy? Because if you are, I'll have to stick my customers in
      order to get out clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No demurrage, Gus, not a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully! Then I'll stick my customers anyhow. It makes the profit all the
      greater, and since they expect to pay a reasonable demurrage I see no
      reason why I should disappoint them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Redell had hung up Cappy summoned into his presence Captain Matt
      Peasley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;what schooners have you got due at any one of our
      northern mills within the next thirty days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley pondered and counted on his big fingers. &ldquo;The <i>Tyee</i>
      will be in from Valparaiso about that time,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got her chartered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. We're using her in our own trade. Skinner will have a cargo ready
      for her by the time she gets back, although we don't know yet where we
      will send her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matt, you tell Skinner he can't have her and to look around for
      some other vessel to take her place. I may give her to him at the last
      minute, but then again I may not. When she arrives at the mill, Matthew,
      my boy, tie her up to the mill dock to await my pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what the devil are you going to do with the <i>Tyee?</i>&rdquo; Matt
      demanded, astounded beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might want to take a cruise for my health and use the <i>Tyee</i> as a
      pleasure boat,&rdquo; Cappy answered enigmatically. &ldquo;They tell me she's as fast
      as a yacht in a breeze of wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer I'm acquainted with you, father-in-law,&rdquo; Matt Peasley
      declared, &ldquo;the less I know you. You can have your <i>Tyee</i>, but for
      every day she is held awaiting your pleasure your personal account will be
      charged with something in three figures. I'll figure out her average
      profit per day for the last five voyages and soak you accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; quoth Cappy Ricks.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks later Alden P. Ricks arrived in New York. After he had been
      driven to his hotel and had removed the stains of travel he telephoned the
      office of Gurney &amp; Harlan and got Gurney, Senior, on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm here, Joe,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Have you followed my instructions
      and cut Joey off at the pockets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, Alden. He's rather desperate as a result, and has been trying to
      borrow money by hypothecating the inheritance due him on his twenty-fifth
      birthday. You see, I didn't give him a second's notice; just told him he
      was spending too much time in play and too much money for pleasure, and
      that until he came into his private fortune he would have to earn any
      money he desired to spend. I have been very firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the stuff, Joe. And is he trying to earn it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so. He's sticking round the office at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! That's because it costs money to go anywhere else. Has he
      succeeded in raising a loan by assigning an interest in his inheritance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. I blocked him at all the banks and with my old friends, and
      I do not think he can borrow as much as he needs from any of his friends.
      They, like him of course, are dependent on their fathers' generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine way to raise a boy! Bully. Well, I'll be down to your office in
      about an hour and take you and Joey to luncheon at India House. You
      haven't forgotten what I wrote you, Joe? You know your part, don't you? .
      . . Well, see that you play your hand well and we'll save that boy yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later the Gurneys were lunching with Cappy Ricks at the one New
      York club to which Cappy belonged&mdash;quaint old India House in Hanover
      Square, haunt of shipping men and shippers, perhaps the best and
      least-known club in New York City. Joey had been unaffectedly glad to see
      his godfather; so much so, indeed, that Cappy rightly guessed Joey had
      designs on the Ricks pocketbook; for after all, as Cappy admitted to
      himself, he is a curmudgeon of a godfather indeed who will refuse to loan
      his godson a much needed twenty-five thousand dollars on gilt-edged
      security. In expectation of an application for a loan before the day
      should be done, however, Cappy was careful not to be alone with Joey for
      an instant, for something told him that only the presence of Gurney,
      Senior, kept Gurney Junior from promptly putting his fortune to the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joey, you young cut-up,&rdquo; Cappy began as the trio settled in the
      smoking room and the waiter brought the coffee and cigars, &ldquo;I see you're
      getting to be quite an amateur sailor. Your Dad tells me you won your last
      race with that schooner yacht of yours in rather pretty fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bully race, Mr. Ricks. I wish you could have been aboard with
      me,&rdquo; Joey declared enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! Catch me on a yacht!&rdquo; Cappy's tones were indicative of profound
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ricks, you're a kill-joy,&rdquo; old Gurney struck in. &ldquo;All you think of is
      making money, and you've made so much of it I should think the game would
      have palled on you long ago. I tell Joey to go it while he's young&mdash;while
      he has the capacity for enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, I tell you now, as I've told you before, you're spoiling this boy.
      When he's twenty-five years old he comes into a fortune and you're not
      even preparing him for the task of handling that money wisely. You bought
      Joey that schooner yacht, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought her cheap,&rdquo; old Joe Gurney protested lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cost a fortune to maintain, Joe. Now if Joey wanted some salt-water
      experience you should have sent him to sea as quartermaster on one of your
      own Red Funnel liners; presently he would have worked up to second mate;
      then first mate, and finally skipper. By that time he would have known the
      salt-water end of his father's business, after which he could sit in at a
      desk and learn the business end. Somehow, Joe, when I see a shipping man's
      son fooling away his time on a pleasure yacht instead of learning the
      shipping business, I feel as if I'd just taken a dose of ipecac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfather is out of sorts,&rdquo; Joey soliloquized sagely, and resolved to
      wait a day or two before broaching the subject of a loan. Cappy Ricks
      surveyed the young fellow severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I've no doubt you're quite a sailor on your handsome
      yacht, in your yachting uniform, with all the real head work to be done by
      your sailing master&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; Joey protested. &ldquo;I'm not that kind of a yachtsman. I'm
      the captain tight and the midshipmite, and the crew take orders from me,
      because I don't employ a sailing master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that when you go on a cruise to the West Indies
      you navigate the yacht yourself&mdash;lay out your own courses and work
      out your own position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey smiled patronizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That's easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Play is always easy. But let me tell you, young man, if you had
      command of a big three-legged windjammer, with a deckload of heavy green
      lumber fresh from the saws, and ran into a stiff sou'-easter such as we
      have out on the Pacific coast, you'd know what real sailoring is like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey could handle her like that,&rdquo; old Gurney declared with pride, and
      snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you, Joey?&rdquo; Cappy Ricks demanded. &ldquo;I have my doubts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think so, Mr. Ricks. I might be a little cautious at first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't think you could,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; old Gurney declared with some warmth. &ldquo;I've been out with
      Joey on his yacht and I know what the boy can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! You're a doddering old softy, Joe. Yachting is one thing and
      sailoring is another. I have an old lumber hooker on Gray's Harbor now,
      loading for a port in Peru, and I'd certainly love to see Joey with her on
      his hands. I'll bet fifty thousand dollars he couldn't sail her down to
      Sobre Vista, discharge her and sail back inside of six months.&rdquo; The old
      schemer chuckled. &ldquo;Lordy me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I'd like to see Joey trying
      to make her point up into the wind! She'd break his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Alden,&rdquo; Old Joe Gurney commenced to bristle. &ldquo;Are you serious
      about that or are you just making conversation bets? Because if you're
      serious I'm just shipping man enough to call you for the sheer sporting
      joy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, you're on!&rdquo; Cappy Ricks almost yelled.
      &ldquo;Put up or shut up&mdash;that is, provided Joey is as big a sport as his
      father and will undertake to sail my schooner <i>Tyee</i> to Sobre Vista
      and back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's a schooner!&rdquo; There was relief in Joey's voice. &ldquo;Why, I'll sail
      any vessel with a fore-and-aft rig. I thought perhaps you were trying to
      ring in a square-rigger on me, and I'm not familiar with them. But a
      schooner&mdash;pooh! Pie for little Joey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got three legs, and with a deck-load of lumber she's cranky and
      topheavy. I'm warning you, Joey. Remember he is a poor ship owner who
      doesn't know his own ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey got up and went to a map laid out on a table, with a piece of plate
      glass over it, to compute the sailing distance from Gray's Harbor to Sobre
      Vista. He could not find Sobre Vista on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Figure the distance to Mollendo and you'll be close enough for all
      practical purposes,&rdquo; Cappy called to him, and winked at the boy's father.
      &ldquo;A little pep, here, boy,&rdquo; he whispered to Gurney, &ldquo;and we'll snare him
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey came back from his study of the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd have the nor'west trades clear to the Line,&rdquo; he remarked to his
      father. &ldquo;After that I'd be liable to bang round for a couple of weeks in
      the doldrums, but in spite of that&mdash;did you say I couldn't do it in
      six months, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said, Joey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the bet, dad,&rdquo; said Joey quietly, &ldquo;and I'll take half of it off your
      hands. I'll give you my note, secured by an assignment of a
      twenty-five-thousand-dollar interest in mother's estate to secure you in
      case Mr. Ricks should win and call you for his winnings&mdash;but he
      hasn't a chance in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money talks,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks warned him and got out his check book. &ldquo;Joe,
      I'll make a check in your favor for fifty thousand dollars and you make
      one in my favor for the same amount. We will then deposit both checks with
      the secretary of the club, who will act as stakeholder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nuff said, Alden P. Ricks. I accept the dare. Sonny, if you're a worse
      sailor-man than you appear to be, you're liable to cost your father a
      sizable wad. However, I can't resist this opportunity to put a nick in the
      Ricks bank roll.&rdquo; Gurney snickered. &ldquo;Alden,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you'll bleed
      for a month of Sundays. Really, this is too easy! For old sake's sake,
      I'll give you a chance to withdraw before it is too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the tail go with the hide, Joe. I don't often bet, but when I do I'm
      no piker. Joey, there's just one little condition I'm going to exact,
      however. I'm going to send one of my own skippers along with you on the <i>Tyee</i>,
      because your license as master only permits you to skipper pleasure boats
      up to a hundred tons net register; so in order to comply with the law I'll
      have to have a sure-enough skipper aboard the <i>Tyee</i>. But he shall
      have orders from me to be nothing but a companion to you, Joey. Once the
      tugboat casts you off, you are to be in supreme command until you
      voluntarily relinquish your authority, when of course he will take the
      ship off your hands. Any relinquishment of authority, however, will be
      tantamount to failure, and you will, of course, lose your twenty-five
      thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a reasonable stipulation, godfather. I accept if father does&mdash;that
      is, provided dad lets me in on half the bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better let the young feller in, Joe,&rdquo; Cappy suggested. &ldquo;If you don't he
      might throw the race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't like to encourage the habit of betting, least of all with
      my own son, but in view of the fact that this is a friendly little bet and&mdash;er&mdash;well,
      you can have half, Joey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Joey. &ldquo;Mr. Ricks, when do I start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The <i>Tyee</i> is loading now, but
      I'll wire them you're coming and to hold her for you. You have time to
      arrange your affairs, pack a trunk and catch the Lake Shore Limited for
      Chicago at five o'clock. From Chicago you take the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. I know the quickest route. Dad, I'll need some money before I
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much, son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a couple of thousand, just to play safe. And I'll have to leave you a
      batch of bills to settle for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, son, I'll settle them. Here's your two thousand. You can pay
      me back out of your winnings on the voyage. And never mind about your note
      or the assignment of an interest in your inheritance. If I cannot take my
      own son's word of honor I don't deserve a son. Just take care of yourself,
      Joey, because if anything should happen to you it would go rather hard
      with your old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote Joey a check for two thousand dollars and took an affectionate
      farewell of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me, my dear young Hotspur,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks commanded him as he
      shook Joey's hand in farewell. &ldquo;The schooner's name is <i>Tyee</i> and
      you'll find her at the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company's mill dock in
      Aberdeen, on Gray's Harbor, Washington. And don't be afraid of her. She
      was built to weather anything. The skipper's name is Mike Murphy, and if
      you can't get along with Mike and learn to love him before you're in the
      ship a week, there's something wrong with you, Joey. Just don't start
      anything with Mike though, because he always finishes strong, and whatever
      he does is always right&mdash;with me. When you get out there he'll show
      you the orders I will have telegraphed him and you have my word of honor,
      boy, that there'll be no double-crossing and no interference unless you
      request it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; cried Joey, and was off to earn twenty-five thousand dollars of
      the easiest money he had ever heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like spearing a fish in a bathtub,&rdquo; murmured Cappy Ricks dreamily, and
      tore up the fifty-thousand-dollar check he had just written. &ldquo;Joe, if your
      boy is such easy game for a pair of old duffers like us, just think what
      soft picking he must have been for that nimble-footed lady with the raven
      hair, the pearly teeth and the eyes that won't behave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she's coarse and brainless, Alden. I can't imagine a boy like my Joey
      falling in love with a woman like that. He ought to know better. Just
      remember how he was raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fooey! Joey isn't in love. He only thinks he is, and the reason he thinks
      it is because she has told him so a hundred times. Can't you just see her
      looking up at Joey with her startled-fawn eyes and saying: 'Oh, you do
      love me, don't you, Joey?' As if the fact that Joey loved her constituted
      the eighth wonder of the world! And she's probably told Joey she'll die if
      he ever ceases to love her; and he's kind and obliging and wouldn't hurt a
      fly if he could avoid it. Why, Joe, you old idiot, you mustn't feel that
      Joey has disgraced himself. Isn't he planning to marry the woman? Only a
      decent man&mdash;a born idealist&mdash;could hold that designing woman in
      such reverence. Blamed if it isn't kind of sweet of the boy, although I <i>would</i>
      love to give him a kick that would jar all his relations&mdash;including
      his father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Joe Gurney gazed at Cappy in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you have a singularly acute knowledge of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I employ about fifteen of 'em round my office; I had several narrow
      escapes in my youth; I have had a sweet and wonderful wife&mdash;and I
      have a replica of her in my daughter. And I do know young men, for I have
      been young myself; and I know old fools like you, Joe, because I've never
      had a son to make an old fool of myself over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now that you've hooked Joey for a six months' voyage, what's next
      on the program?&rdquo; Gurney asked after a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy smiled&mdash;a prescient little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm going to pull off a wedding,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I'm going to marry
      Joey to the sweetest, nicest, healthiest, prettiest, brainiest little lady
      of twenty summers that ever threatened to put the Ricks organization on
      the toboggan. She's my private secretary and I've got to get rid of her or
      some of the young fellows in our office will be killing each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here, Alden, my boy, go slow! I ought to be consulted in this
      matter. Who is this young lady and what are her antecedents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, who's running this layout?&rdquo; Cappy demanded. &ldquo;Didn't you come to me
      squealing for help? Joe, take a back seat and let me try my hand without
      any advice from you. The girl's name is Doris Kenyon and she's an orphan.
      Her father used to be the general manager of my redwood mill on Humboldt
      Bay, and her mother was a girlhood friend of my late wife's; so naturally
      I've established a sort of protectorate over her. She has to work for a
      living, and any time there's a potentially fine, two-million-dollar
      husband like Joey lying round loose I like to see some deserving working
      girl land the cuss. As a matter of fact, it's almost a crime to steer her
      against Joey in his present state. But,&rdquo; Cappy added, &ldquo;I have a notion
      that before Joey gets rid of that hula-hula girl he's going to be a
      sadder, wiser and poorer young man than he is at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plan, then, is to give Joey six months away from his captor in order
      that he may forget her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Absence makes the heart grow colder in cases like the one under
      discussion, and the sea is a great place for a fellow to do some quiet,
      sane, uninterrupted thinking. The sea, at night particularly, is
      productive of much introspection and speculation on the various aspects of
      life, and in order to make Joey forget this vampire in a hurry all that is
      necessary is to have a real woman round him for a while. The first thing
      he knows he'll be making comparisons and the contrast will appall him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do. Joey's future wife accompanies him on the voyage, and my
      bully port captain, Mike Murphy, and his amiable sister go along to
      chaperone the party and make up a foursome at bridge. I've had a naval
      architect at work on the old cabin of the <i>Tyee</i>, putting in some
      extra staterooms, bathrooms, and so on, and in order to make a space for
      the passengers I subsidized the two squarehead mates into berthing with
      the crew in the fo'-castle. Doris always did want to take a voyage in one
      of the Blue Star windjammers, and I had promised to send her at the first
      convenient opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deep-dyed, nefarious old villain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Cupid Ricks, eh? Well, it's lots of fun, Joe, this butting in on
      love's young dream. And I'm just so constituted I've got to run other
      people's affairs for them or I wouldn't be happy. I do think, however,
      that this house party on the old <i>Tyee</i> is about the slickest deal I
      have ever put over. Joe, they're going to be right comfortable. I've
      shipped a maid for the girls, and the cook this time is several degrees
      superior to the average maritime specimen, for there's nothing like a
      couple of days of bum cooking to upset tempers&mdash;and I'm taking no
      chances. Also, just before I left I gave your future daughter-in-law her
      quarterly dividend&mdash;you see, when her father died I had to sort of
      look after the family, and I ran a bluff that Kenyon had some Ricks Lumber
      &amp; Logging Company stock&mdash;you know, Joe. Proud stuff! I had to
      hornswoggle them. Well, as I say, I gave her the money, and my girl Florry
      went shopping with her. Sports clothes? Wow! Wow! White skirts, blue
      jersey, little sailor hat&mdash;man&mdash;oh, man, the stage is set to the
      last detail! I even had them ship a piano. Doris plays the guitar and has
      a pleasing voice, and just for good measure I threw in a crackajack
      cabinet phonograph and a hundred records with enough sentimental drip to
      sink the schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe Gurney stared at his old friend rather helplessly and shook his head.
      Such finesse was beyond his comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, now,&rdquo; Cappy continued, &ldquo;the wisdom of my course? I insisted that
      you cut off Joey's allowance and get him hungry for money. You did&mdash;and
      he got hungry. He would have been posted at his clubs in thirty days; it
      is probable he owed a few bets here and there; his tailor may have needed
      money. Consequently, by the time I arrived on the scene he was ripe for
      any legitimate enterprise that would bring him in the needful funds; we
      arranged the enterprise and he promptly smothered it. Right off, Joe, your
      son said to himself: 'It will be almost a year before I come into my
      inheritance, and in the interim I'm going to get married, and a married
      man who lives on the scale my wife will expect me to assume is going to
      need a lot more money than a clerkship in his father's shipping office
      will bring him. Now, there's Tootsy-Wootsy out in Reno with a five months'
      sentence staring her in the eye before she'll be free to marry me, and I
      can't very well go out to Reno to visit her without running the risk of
      incurring my father's displeasure or the tongue of gossip. Consequently, I
      have five months' time to kill, also, and how better can I kill it than by
      a jolly sea voyage in a bally old lumber hooker? I can easily win
      twenty-five thousand dollars from my godfather, and that twenty-five
      thousand will carry us along until dad turns over my mother's estate to
      me. Fine business! I'll go to it.' And, Joe, he's done gone! Of course I'm
      going to win his twenty-five thousand bet because he doesn't know what it
      means to discharge a vessel in Sobre Vista, and Mike Murphy has orders
      from me to hire all the available stevedores there to do something else
      while Joey is trying to hire them to discharge the <i>Tyee</i>. Don't
      worry, Joe! The country is safe in the capable hands of Mike Murphy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. And the twenty-five thousand dollars you will win from Joey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will reimburse me for the extraordinary expense I've been to in saving
      your son. If Joey's end of the bet doesn't cover I'll nick you, Joseph,
      although I figure Joey's end of it will pay the fiddler. He won't miss it
      out of his two millions. Besides, I've noticed that the only experience
      worth while is the kind you pay real money for&mdash;and Joey has to buy
      his experience the same as the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five days later Cappy Ricks dropped into the Red Funnel Line and laid a
      telegram on old Joe Gurney's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and see if you can't work up a couple of
      cheers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurney read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aberdeen, Wash., June 3, 1916
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden P. Ricks
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey arrived bung up and bilge free. Had loaded and hauled into stream,
      waiting for him. Came out in launch, climbed Jacob's ladder and stood on
      rail, sizing up ship. Saw Doris and almost fell face down on deck. He says
      Doris is a dream, she says Joey is a dear. Take it from me, boss, it is
      all over but the wedding bells.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;M. CUPID MURPHY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Old Joe Gurney took Cappy Ricks' hand in both of his and shook it
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My worries are over, Alden,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You have, indeed, been my
      friend in need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My troubles and Joey's are just commencing, however,&rdquo; Cappy retorted
      blithely. &ldquo;However&mdash;'never trouble trouble until trouble troubles
      you' is my motto. Where's that hundred-and-six-foot schooner yacht of
      Joey's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's at her moorings in Greenpoint Basin. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to borrow her for a cruise to San Francisco, via the Panama Canal.
      Joey and his bride can sail her back. May I have her, to do what I please
      with, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden, don't ask foolish questions. Take her and God bless you! Joey owns
      her, but I pay the bills; so her skipper takes orders from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Joey's schooner <i>Seafarer</i> was standing out to sea
      past Sandy Hook, but Cappy Ricks was not aboard her, for that ingenious
      schemer had boarded a train and gone back to San Francisco and his lumber
      and ships.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks' meditations were interrupted by a knock at the door of his
      private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he piped, and his son-in-law, Captain Matt Peasley, stuck his
      head in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Tyee</i> is sailing in, Cappy,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The Merchants'
      Exchange has just telephoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an infernal lie,&rdquo; Cappy shrilled excitedly. &ldquo;It can't be the <i>Tyee</i>.
      If it is, she's two months ahead of her schedule, and by the Holy
      Pink-Toed Prophet, I fixed up that schedule myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Joey didn't like your schedule and re-arranged it to suit
      himself,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! That infernal young scoundrel put it over me? Preposterous!
      Why, Mike Murphy was on the job. Get out, Matt, and don't come in here
      again today throwing scares into the old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Cappy's confidence in human nature was badly jarred when
      Captain Michael J. Murphy was announced two hours later. Indeed Cappy
      could scarcely credit his sense of sight when the redoubtable Michael
      entered the room. He glared at the worthy fellow over the rims of his
      spectacles for fully a minute while Murphy stood fidgeting just inside the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Blue Star despot presently, &ldquo;all I've got to say to you,
      Mike Murphy, is that you're certainly a hell of a seaman to stand idly by
      and see that young Joey do me up like this. Give an account of yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're engaged,&rdquo; Murphy protested valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my work, Mike, not yours. Don't take any credit that isn't coming
      to you. I want a report on your end of this deal. How does it happen that
      this boy harpoons me for twenty-five thousand dollars? Have the <i>cargadores</i>
      at Sobre Vista gone on the water wagon? Did Joey out-bid you for their
      services? Have they added a lot more lighters to their lighterage fleet?
      Has the surf quit rolling in on the beach? Have the inhabitants of Sobre
      Vista been converted to the Mohammedan faith and declined to celebrate
      saints' days and holy days? Is there smallpox in the town, that the
      quietus has been put on fiestas and fandangoes, and has Peru been annexed
      by Chile and the celebration of the national holidays forbidden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Ricks. It's the same old <i>manana</i> burg. The trouble was that
      Joey is a better sailorman than he appeared to be. He cracked on all the
      way down and made a smashing voyage, and, of course, as soon as we got
      there he went ashore. Two other schooners were there ahead of us. One was
      loading general cargo and the other was discharging it, and when Joey
      heard they had been there a month he investigated conditions and saw where
      you had him. Mr. Ricks, he came back as mad as a hatter. Of course I saw
      he would have to wait until the other schooners were out of the way before
      he could begin discharging, because they had first call on the lighters;
      so in view of the situation and the fact that Miss Murphy and Doris were a
      bit tired of the ship and wanted to go ashore and see the back country, I
      organized a trip for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left Joey aboard the Tyee, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And there's where I made my fatal break. The minute my back was
      turned the son of a pirate got busy. It appears there was a six-inch waste
      pipe leading from the crew's lavatory out under the stern of the ship, and
      this pipe had rusted away and broken off at the flange just inside the
      skin of the ship sometime during the vessel's previous voyage. Of course
      it happened while she was homeward bound in ballast, and was standing so
      high out of the water that this vent where the pipe was broken was above
      the waterline; consequently not enough of a leak developed to be
      noticeable. At the mill dock, however, after we got her under-deck cargo
      aboard, the vessel had settled until this vent was under water, and
      immediately she developed a mysterious leak. In fact, due to the enormous
      pressure, the water came in faster than the pumps could handle it.
      Fortunately, however, we discovered where the leak was, though it was then
      too late to mend it. To do so we would have had to take out the under-deck
      cargo again. So I just whittled out a six-inch wooden plug, fastened it to
      the end of the boat hook, ran it down the narrow space through which the
      broken pipe led, found the vent, hammered the plug home, stopped the leak,
      pumped out the well, finished taking on cargo and sailed for Sobre Vista.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small leak will sink a great ship,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks murmured. &ldquo;I think I
      anticipate the blow-off, Mike; but proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately for us that cargo of lumber we had was for the Peruvian
      government. They were going to use it in the construction of barracks or a
      new customhouse or something&mdash;and Joey knew this. And he knew about
      that plug. So the minute my back was turned he pulled out the plug and the
      water came in and trickled all through the cargo and the ship commenced to
      settle. But Joey didn't care. He knew a little salt water couldn't hurt
      the lumber. When the top of the <i>Tyee's</i> rail was flush with the
      water he plugged the hole again, got his crew busy with the pumps, and by
      judiciously plugging and unplugging that leak he kept the crew pumping all
      day and all night without raising the vessel an inch, and the people
      ashore could see the streams of water cascading overside and the crew
      pumping like mad. And presently Joey gave up, went ashore, sought the
      captain of the port and put up a hard luck story about a leak in his ship&mdash;a
      leak he couldn't find anywhere&mdash;a leak that was getting away from
      him, because his men were too exhausted to do any more pumping. And he
      said his ship would get water-logged and settle until the surf began to
      break over her. And presently the deck lashings would part under the
      battering of the surf and the deck load would go by the board. Half of it
      would drift out to sea, and the other half would pound on the beach and
      get filled with sand, which would dull the saws and planes of the
      carpenters when they came to cut it up. Also, the ship's cabin would be
      sure to go, and unless he had help he would have to abandon the vessel and
      she would lie there, submerged, at anchor, a menace to the navigation of
      the port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrel! The in-fer-nal young scoundrel!&rdquo; cried Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he got away with it, sir. Remember our cargo was for the Peruvian
      government and they'd had the devil's own time getting it; consequently
      they couldn't afford to lose any part of it and have their anchorage
      ground menaced by a derelict. So the captain of the port took it up with
      the commandant of the local garrison, and the commandant, as Joey
      expressed it, heard the Macedonian cry and got busy. He commandeered all
      the lighters the other schooners were using; the soldiers rounded up the
      <i>cargadores</i> at the point of the bayonet, and they started
      discharging the American schooner <i>Tyee</i>, with the spiggoty soldiers
      swelling Joey's crew at the pumps and Joey doing business with that wooden
      plug according to the requirements. Fortunately there weren't any surf
      days that week, and the way the cargo poured out of the <i>Tyee</i> was a
      shame and a disgrace. And when it was all out Joey plugged the leak again,
      pumped out the ship, and wired me at Mollendo to hurry back with the
      ladies or he'd sail without me. So you can see for yourself, Mr. Ricks, it
      was a hard hand to beat. And his luck held. He cracked on all the way home
      and, as you know, sir, the <i>Tyee</i> is fast in a breeze of wind, and
      you told me not to interfere unless he asked me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite his disappointment Cappy Ricks lay back in his chair and laughed
      until he wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mike,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;it's worth twenty-five thousand dollars to know
      a boy who can pull one like that. What do you think of him, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll do. His father has spoiled him, but not altogether. I think a heap
      of him, sir. Remember I've been shipmates with him a trifle over four
      months, and that's a pretty good test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mike. I forgive you, my boy. I hope Miss Murphy enjoyed the
      trip. Tell her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Joey Gurney, accompanied by Miss Doris Kenyon entered
      unannounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, godfather,&rdquo; yelled Joey joyously. He jerked the old man out of his
      chair and hugged him. &ldquo;I'm back with your schooner, sir. She was easy to
      navigate, but that was a cold deck you handed me in Sobre Vista&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you, Joey, glad to see you,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted. &ldquo;Ah, and
      here's my little secretary again. Miss Kenyon, this is a pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Joey interrupted him, &ldquo;the lady's name is no longer Miss
      Kenyon. She is now Mrs. Joseph K. Gurney, Junior. The minute we got ashore
      at Meiggs' wharf and could shake the Murphys, who stood out till the last
      for a church wedding, we chartered a taxicab, went up to the City Hall,
      procured a license, rounded up a preacher&mdash;and got married. What do
      you know about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're as fast as a second-story worker, Joey. I shall kiss the bride.&rdquo;
       And Cappy did. Then he sat down and stared at the fruit of his cunning
      labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; cried Joey. &ldquo;Kick in, godfather, kick in. You owe me
      twenty-five thousand dollars, and if I'm going to support a wife I'll need
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy summoned Mr. Skinner, who felicitated the happy pair and departed
      pursuant to Cappy's order, to make out a check for Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cappy, as he handed the groom his winnings, &ldquo;you get out
      of here with your bride, Joey, and I'll telephone Florry and we'll
      organize a wedding supper. And to-morrow morning, Joey, I'd like to see
      you at ten o'clock, if you can manage to be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey promised, and hastened away with his bride.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      True to his word he presented himself in Cappy's lair promptly at ten next
      morning. The old gentleman was sitting rigidly erect on the extreme edge
      of his chair; in his hand he held a typewritten statement with a column of
      figures on it, and he eyed Joey very appraisingly over the rims of his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;sit down. I'm awfully glad you cabled that
      hula-hula girl of yours in Reno that the stuff was all off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey's mouth flew open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, how did you know?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know everything, Joey. I'm that kind of an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;for heaven's sake don't let a whisper of
      that affair reach my wife.&rdquo; He wrung his hands. &ldquo;I told her she was the
      only girl I had ever loved&mdash;that I'd never been engaged before&mdash;that
      I&mdash;oh, godfather, if she ever discovers I've lied to her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll not discover it. Compose yourself, Joey. I've seen to all that. I
      knew you'd give Doris the same old song and dance; everybody's doing it,
      you know, so I took pains to see to it that you'll never have to eat your
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have been crazy to engage myself to that woman,&rdquo; Joey wailed. &ldquo;I
      don't know why I did it&mdash;I don't know how it happened&mdash;Oh, Mr.
      Ricks, please believe me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Joey, I do. I understand perfectly, because at the tender age of
      twenty-four I proposed marriage to a snake-charmer lady in the old Eden
      Musee. She was forty years old if she was a day, but she carried her years
      well and hid the wrinkles with putty, or something. Barring a slight
      hare-lip, she was a fairly handsome woman&mdash;in the dark.&rdquo; He reached
      into a compartment of his desk and drew forth a package of letters tied
      with red ribbon. &ldquo;You can have these, Joey,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;only I
      shouldn't advise keeping them where your wife may find them. They are your
      letters to your Honolulu lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey let out a bleat of pure ecstacy and seized them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't read them, sir, have you?&rdquo; he queried, blushing desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my boy. I had to, you know, because I was buying something and I
      wanted to make certain I got value received. Pretty gooey stuff, Joey!
      Read aloud, they sound like a cow's hoof settling into a wet meadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so glad she took it sensibly,&rdquo; Joey announced, for he was anxious to
      change the topic of conversation. &ldquo;I suppose she saw it was the only way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she didn't, my son. Don't flatter yourself. On your way out West to
      join the <i>Tyee</i> you wrote her every day on the train. You told her
      about your bet with me, and who I was and all about me. Lucky for you that
      you did, and doubly lucky for you that you cabled her the jilt from Sobre
      Vista, or she would not have come to me with her troubles. Joey, that must
      have taken courage on your part. It's mighty hard for a gentleman to cable
      a lady and break an engagement. That's the lady's privilege, Joey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was desperate, Mr. Ricks. I had to. I had to have her out of
      the way by the time I got back, or Doris might have found it out. You see,
      I wanted to clear the atmosphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you clouded it for fair! You see, Joey, in all those letters it
      appears that you never once mentioned the words marriage or engagement.
      But your cablegram was an admission that an engagement existed, and the
      lady was smart enough to realize that. It appears also that about a week
      after you cleared for Sobre Vista her annoying husband was killed by a
      taxicab in New York, so that saved her any divorce proceedings; and when
      your cablegram reached her she was a single lady who had been heartlessly
      jilted. The first thing she did was to hire a lawyer, and the first person
      that lawyer called on was Alden P. Ricks, the old family friend. It
      appears a suit for breach of promise was to be instituted unless a fairly
      satisfactory financial settlement could be arrived at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did she want?&rdquo; Joey barely whispered the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you settle for? I'll pay it out of my inheritance, Mr.
      Ricks. Don't worry! I won't see you stuck, for you've stood by me through
      thick and thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I didn't give her anything, Joey. I just had her lawyer bring her on
      to San Francisco for a conference. Of course when lunch time came round
      and I hadn't heard any proposition I felt I could submit to your father, I
      invited Miss Fontaine and her lawyer to luncheon with me in the Palace
      Hotel Grill, and while we were lunching, who should come up and greet me
      but my old friend, the Duke of Killiekrankie, formerly Duncan MacGregor,
      first mate of our barkentine <i>Retriever</i>. Mac is an excellent fellow
      and for some time I had felt he merited promotion. So I made him a duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the duke was awfully glad to see me, and being a gentleman I
      couldn't do less than introduce him to the lady and her lawyer. He only
      stayed at our table a minute and then rejoined his friends, but all during
      the meal I could see Betsy Jane's mind wasn't on her breach-of-promise
      suit. She asked me several questions about the duke, and I told her I
      didn't know much about him except that he was sinfully rich and a
      globe-trotter, and that we'd met in Paris. Lies, Joey, but pardonable, I
      hope, under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joey, it seems that she and the duke were registered at the same
      hotel and I'll be shot if his lordship didn't meet her&mdash;by accident,
      of course&mdash;in the lobby that afternoon. He lifted his hat and she
      smiled and they had a chat. The next day she cut an engagement with her
      lawyer and me to go motoring with the duke in my French car, and Florry's
      chauffeur driving, for, of course, the duke was an expensive luxury and I
      was trying to save a dollar wherever possible. That night the duke gave a
      dinner party in honor of the lady&mdash;and he gave it aboard his yacht,
      the <i>Doris</i>, formerly the <i>Seafarer</i>, right out here in San
      Francisco harbor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joey went up and put his arm round Cappy's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cappy Ricks, Cappy Ricks!&rdquo; he cried, and then his voice broke and his
      eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cappy continued, &ldquo;I had sort o' suspected she might pull that
      breach-of-promise stuff on you, Joey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you suspect it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I sort of suspected you were going to marry Doris Kenyon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You planned to get us together on the same ship&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only place I could think of where you were safe from the Honolulu lady
      and couldn't run away from Doris, Joey. Well, as I say, I had sort of
      suspected she might sue you and disgrace you and break the heart of that
      little girl I'd picked out for you long before you ever met her&mdash;so I
      started to get there first and with the heaviest guns, I borrowed your
      yacht for the duke and had him sail her round himself, so he'd have her
      here to give the dinner party on. Then I got a Burke's peerage and told
      MacGregor who he was and had him study up on his family history and get
      acquainted with his sister, Lady Mary, and his younger brother, the
      Honorable Cecil Something-or-other&mdash;in particular he was not to
      forget to rave about the grouse shooting in Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy paused and puffed his cigar meditatively for half a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;any time you run a bluff, run a good one. If you're
      starring a globe-trotting duke, have his ancestry all straightened out in
      advance, because he's bound to break into the newspapers and the motto of
      the newspaper editor is 'Show me.' And the yacht&mdash;just one of the
      props of the comedy, Joey; and with a little cockney steward in livery to
      say 'Your ludship'; and the name of the yacht changed in case she'd ever
      heard you speak about the <i>Seafarer;</i> and the cabin done over in
      white enamel with mahogany trim; and a new set of dishes with your family
      crest and the name of the yacht on every piece in case you had ever had
      her aboard; and a private secretary&mdash;borrowed him from my general
      manager, Skinner, by the way&mdash;we were certainly there when it came to
      throwing the ducal front. And we got away with it, for MacGregor's accent
      is just Scotchy enough, and he comes of good family and has excellent
      manners. Yes, I must say Mac made a very comfortable duke. Skinner's young
      man tells me it would bring tears of joy to your eyes to see him kiss the
      lady's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joey, the upshot of it was that after paying violent court to the
      lady for two weeks&mdash;Mac said he could have pulled the stunt the night
      of the dinner, for she fell for the title right way, but I told him to
      make haste slowly&mdash;the duke received a cablegram calling him home
      from his furlough. Oh, yes, Joey, I had him in the army. Any young
      unattached duke that doesn't join the British army these days doesn't get
      by in good society, and I had my duke on a six months' furlough to recover
      from his wounds. Fortunately a bunch of cedar shingles had fallen on Mac's
      foot recently and he was dog lame, which strengthened the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the duke was up in the air right away. In a passionate scene he
      confessed his love for that damsel of yours, Joey, and laid his dukedom at
      her feet. Would she marry him P. D. Q. and help him sail the yacht home?
      Would she? 'Oh, darling, this is so sudden!' she cried, and almost swooned
      in his arms. From a cabaret to a dukedom. Some jump! Sail the yacht home
      to England through the mine fields and submarines? Perfectly ripping, by
      Jove! I give you my word, Joey, she tacked on one of those New York
      British accents for the duke's special benefit. There was a lot of beam to
      her <i>a</i>'s, Mac told me, but blamed little molded depth to her
      mentality. So they were married in haste, and after the duke had seen his
      bride in the elevator bound for their rooms at the hotel, he excused
      himself to get a highball. And I guess he got the highball, because I find
      it in this expense account he turned in to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds like a fairy tale,&rdquo; Joey murmured in an awed voice. &ldquo;What did
      the duke do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came right down to this office and informed me he was, plumb weary of the
      life of a bon vivant and was anxious to get to sea again. So I made him
      master of a new steamer we acquired recently, and he's gone out to
      Vladivostok with munitions for the Russians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn't you give him some money, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why should I? Didn't I give him command of a steamer? You can slip
      him a fat check if you feel that way about it, but I never coddle my
      skippers, Joey, until I'm sure they're worth while. I think, however, that
      Mac will make good. He's very thorough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;what became of Ernestine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by Godfrey, that's a sad story, Joey. It seems she waited at the
      hotel for the duke to come back and he didn't come, so the following
      morning she went down to the water front looking for the yacht&mdash;and
      the yacht was gone. During the night I'd had it towed over to Sausalito;
      consequently the launchman she hired couldn't find it down in Mission Bay,
      and back to the beach she came. After a couple of days had passed,
      however, she commenced to smell a rat, so she came down to my office and
      asked me if I'd seen anything of the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, yes, I have,' I told her. 'The old duke came in here yesterday
      afternoon, soused to the guards, and complaining he'd been cruelly
      deceived into marrying a two-time loser with a couple of youngsters, and
      inasmuch as he was certain the family wouldn't receive her he was leaving
      the United States immediately, never to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And this morning the justice of the peace who performed the ceremony
      mailed him the license, which has been duly recorded in the office of the
      Secretary of State in accordance with law; and inasmuch as the license was
      sent to him in my care I am holding it in our safe until he calls for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joey, she looked at me and she knew the stuff was all off. She'd
      married the duke; I had the license to prove it, and of course she
      realized her breach of promise suit and claim for a million dollars' worth
      of heart balm would be laughed out of court if she had the crust to
      present it. So she did the next best thing. She abused me like a
      pickpocket and ended up by getting hysterical when I told her how I'd
      swindled her. When she got through crying I lectured her on the error of
      her ways and suggested that inasmuch as she had had one divorce already,
      another wouldn't be much of a strain on her, and I'd foot the bill for
      separating her legally from John Doe, alias the duke, on a charge of
      desertion. Then I offered her a thousand dollars and a ticket back to New
      York for the surrender of all your letters to her and that infernal
      cablegram and a release of all claims against you. I guess she was broke
      for she grabbed it in a hurry, Joey. The atmosphere is now clear, my son,
      and nothing further remains to be done in the premises, save settle the
      bill of expense. Fortunately the <i>Tyee</i> made money on that fast
      voyage under your command, but the cost of bringing the yacht round from
      New York, doing over the cabin, buying the new dishes with the crest, and
      settling with the lady should rightfully be borne by you. As I say, the
      duke was expensive, for the rascal certainly rolled 'em high. Skinner has
      made me up a statement of the total cost, with interest at six per cent to
      date, and it appears, Joey, that you owe your godfather $12,143.18. On the
      day you come into your inheritance, add six per cent to that sum and send
      me a check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the twenty-five thousand dollars I won from you&mdash;&rdquo; Joey began,
      but Cappy held up a rigid finger, enjoining silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to stick your dub of a father for that, as a penance for his
      sins of omission, Joey; for by the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, if ever a boy

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the period when Joey Gurney was busy doing all that Cappy Ricks
      desired him to do and some things that were slightly off Cappy's program,
      the president emeritus of the Blue Star Navigation Company and allied
      interests was discovering that it is one thing to declare for the simple
      life and quite another to live it. The Great War challenged so much of the
      Ricks interest that he could not bear to live far from morning and evening
      editions&mdash;and he wanted them red hot off the presses. Things were
      doing in the shipping world. The most inconceivable trades were being
      consummated daily, freights were soaring, lumber prices had reached an
      unprecedentedly high level and promised to go higher; there was something
      doing every minute and not enough minutes in a working day to accommodate
      half of these somethings. What more natural, therefore, than that Cappy
      presently should find himself caught in the maelstrom, even though he told
      himself daily that, come what might <i>he</i> would keep out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first indefinite evidence that he was about to be engulfed came in the
      form of a newspaper story, ex the steamer <i>Timaru</i>, from Sydney, via
      Tahiti. There it was, as big as a church&mdash;a paragraph of it, tucked
      away in a column-and-a-half story of the bombardment of Papeete by the
      German Pacific fleet early in September of 1914:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An incident of the bombardment was the sinking of the German freight
      steamer <i>Valkyrie</i> by shells from the German fleet. The vessel had
      been captured by the French gunboat <i>Zeile</i> some weeks previous and
      was at anchor in the harbor, under the guns of the <i>Zeile</i>, when the
      German squadron appeared off the entrance. The gunboat immediately was
      made the target for the German guns, and sunk. During the attack, however,
      a wild shell missed the <i>Zeile</i> and struck the <i>Valkyrie</i>,
      tearing a great hole in her hull and causing her to sink in ten fathoms at
      her anchorage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten fathoms! Sixty feet! Why, at that depth Cappy should have known that
      her masts and funnel would be above water; that in all probability she
      carried war-risk insurance; that she was so far from anywhere the
      underwriters would have abandoned her, even had she not been a prize of
      war, since there are no appliances in Papeete for salving a vessel of her
      size; that she could be raised if one cared to spend a little money on
      doing it; that one projectile probably had not ruined her beyond repair;
      that she was a menace to navigation in Papeete Harbor and hence would have
      to be gotten out of the way, either by dynamite or auction; that&mdash;well,
      any number of thats should have occurred to Cappy Ricks to suggest the
      advisability of keeping track of the wreck of the <i>Valkyrie</i>.
      However, for some mysterious reasons&mdash;his resentment against the
      German cause, probably&mdash;the golden prospect never appealed to him,
      for when he had finished reading the article he merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you know about that? Skinner, it's a mighty lucky thing for
      that German admiral that I'm not the Kaiser, for I'd certainly make him
      hard to catch. The idea of sinking that fine steamer&mdash;and a German
      steamer at that! Here was the little old French gunboat, about as
      invulnerable as a red-cedar shingle; and instead of moving into proper
      position and raking her with their light guns&mdash;instead of calling on
      her to surrender&mdash;these Germans had to go to work in a hurry and
      inaugurate a campaign of frightfulness. The minute they were off the
      harbor&mdash;Zowie! Blooey! Bam! It was all over but the cheering, and
      they'd chucked an eight-inch projectile through a ship that was worth four
      of the gunboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, that's what I call spilling the beans. Why they didn't take
      their time, recapture that freighter and give her skipper a chance to
      hustle across to San Francisco or Honolulu and intern, is a mystery to me.
      The idea! Why, for that German fleet to waste ammunition on that Jim-Crow
      town and a hand-me-down gunboat was equivalent to John L. Sullivan
      whittling out a handle on a piece of two-by-four common fir in order to
      attack a cockroach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy was so incensed that he growled about the Germans for an hour. Then
      he forgot the <i>Valkyrie</i>, notwithstanding the fact that the press
      jogged his memory again when the German fleet, deciding that prudence was
      the better part of valor, fled from the Pacific to escape the Japanese,
      only to be destroyed in the South Atlantic by the British fleet. A resume
      of the operations of the German squadron in the Pacific brought forth
      mention of the destruction of the <i>Zeile</i> and the <i>Valkyrie</i>.
      However, Cappy's mind was not in Tahiti now, but off the Falkland Islands,
      for he was very much pro-Ally and devoted more thought to military and
      naval strategy than he did to the lumber and shipping business.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the climax of Cappy's indignation over the disaster to the <i>Valkyrie</i>
      was not attained until a few months later when, in conversation on the
      floor of the Merchants' Exchange with the skipper of the schooner <i>Tarus</i>,
      who happened to have been in Papeete at the bombardment, he learned he had
      done the German admiral a grave injustice. He came back to his office,
      boiling, declaring the French were a crazy nation, and that, after all, he
      could recall meeting one or two fine Germans during the course of a fairly
      busy career. He summoned Mr. Skinner and Matt Peasley to hear the sordid
      tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that steamer <i>Valkyrie</i> the Germans were supposed to have
      sunk by accident in the harbor of Papeete during the bombardment in
      September of 1914?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I read something about it in the papers at the time,&rdquo; Mr.
      Skinner replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; Matt Peasley demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Germans didn't sink her at all, Matt! The Frenchmen did it,&rdquo;
       Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;The crazy, frog-eating jumping-jacks of Frenchmen! The
      tramp wasn't flying the German flag&mdash;naturally the Frenchmen had
      hauled it down; so the Germans didn't investigate her. Besides, they were
      in a hurry&mdash;you'll remember the Japs were on their trail at the time;
      so they just devoted forty minutes to shooting up the town, and beat it. I
      don't suppose they ever knew they hit the <i>Valkyrie</i>; perhaps they
      figured that, having sunk the gunboat, the <i>Valkyrie</i> could up hook
      and away at her leisure, since there was nothing left to prevent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Makes me sick to talk about it; but the skipper of the <i>Taurus</i>
      was there at the time and he tells me that, though the <i>Valkyrie</i> was
      pretty well down by the stern, her bulkheads were holding and she wouldn't
      have sunk if those blamed Frenchmen, fearful that the German fleet was
      coming back after her, hadn't gone aboard and opened her sea cocks! Yes,
      sir. Rather than risk having her recaptured, they opened her sea cocks and
      sunk her! And, at that, they didn't have sense enough to run her out to
      deep water. No! They had to do the trick as she lay at anchor; and there
      she lies still, a menace to navigation and a perennial reminder to those
      Papeete Frenchmen that he who acts in haste will repent at leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this outburst Mr. Skinner made some perfunctory remark, attributing the
      situation to a lack of efficiency, while Matt Peasley went back to his
      office and grieved as he reflected on the corrosive action of salt water
      on those fine, seven-year-old engines.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passed. Mr. Skinner developed a pallor and irritability that bespoke
      all too truly an attack of nerves, from overwork, and sore against his
      will was hustled off to Honolulu for a rest while Cappy Ricks had the
      audacity to take charge of the lumber business. Whereupon Mr. J. Augustus
      Redell, of the West Coast Trading Company, discovered the unprotected
      condition of the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company and promptly, in sheer
      wanton deviltry, proceeded to sew Cappy Ricks up on an order for a million
      grape stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word here regarding the said J. Augustus Redell. He was a blithe, joyous
      creature, still in the sunny thirties, and what he didn't know about the
      lumber business&mdash;particularly the marketing of lumber products&mdash;could
      be tucked into anybody's eyes without impairing their eyesight. Mr. Redell
      had fought his way up from office boy with the Black Butte Lumber Company
      to lumber broker with offices of his own. He had owned a retail yard in
      which business he had gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo; for more money than the world appeared
      to contain. But he had fought his way back and paid a hundred cents on the
      dollar, including some hundred and forty thousand dollars he had owed the
      Ricks mills at the time of his collapse. Because he was young and fine and
      good-natured and brave and brilliant, Cappy had always admired J. Augustus
      Redell, but after the latter had so splendidly re-established his credit
      and formed a partnership with a Peruvian gentleman, one Senor Luiz
      Almeida, known locally as Live Wire Luiz, Cappy found that he had for the
      genial J. Augustus an admiration that amounted to affection. The West
      Coast Trading Company, under which title Live Wire Luiz and J. Augustus
      Redell did a lumber brokerage business with Mexico, Central American and
      South American countries principally, had Cappy Ricks' entire confidence,
      although he would have died rather than admit this. Live Wire Luiz he
      ignored and always dismissed as a factor in the affairs of that company,
      but whenever Redell had a deal on that was too heavy for his financial
      sinews, Cappy could always be depended upon to lend a helping hand. On his
      part, Redell revered Cappy Ricks as only an idealistic and naturally
      lovable rascal of a boy can revere an idealistic and lovable old man. To
      J. Augustus Redell little, old, naive, whimsical, gentle, terrible,
      brilliant, cunning, generous, altruistic, prudent, youthful old Cappy
      Ricks was a joy forever. With the impishness of his tender years, Mr.
      Redell could conceive of no greater joy than picking on Cappy Ricks just
      to see the latter fight back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite early in their friendship, the astute Redell discovered a rift in
      Cappy's armor&mdash;two rifts, in fact. The first was that Cappy feared
      and loathed old age and fiercely resented even the most shadowy intimation
      that with age he was, to employ a sporting phrase, &ldquo;losing his punch.&rdquo; The
      second weakness that lay exposed to Redell was Cappy's passion for
      wringing a profit, by ingenious means, from apparently barren soil where
      no profit had ever hitherto burgeoned. At heart Cappy was a speculator;
      only the fact that he was a prudent and careful speculator had conduced to
      enrich him rather than impoverish him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Cappy was fully convinced, from optical evidence, that J. Augustus
      Redell was a gambler. He admired Redell's genius for business, the
      soundness of his decisions, the alertness of his mind and the brilliance
      of his financial <i>coups</i>, but&mdash;he deprecated the younger man's
      daring. Cappy called it recklessness. By degrees the old gentleman had
      come to assume a proprietary interest in Gus Redell and the latter's
      affairs, for the younger man frequently sought counsel from Cappy and not
      infrequently, a loan! Cappy knew his young friend to be the soul of manly
      honor, but&mdash;he was young! Ah, yes! He was young. Ergo, he was
      foolish. True, his foolishness had not as yet been discovered, but Cappy
      was certain it would come to the surface sooner or later. The boy was
      reckless&mdash;a gambler. Cappy abhorred gambling. He never gambled.
      Occasionally he speculated! What more natural, therefore, than that little
      Cappy should presently arrogate to himself the privilege of stabbing young
      J. Augustus to the vitals from time to time, just to impress upon the boy
      the knowledge that this is a hard, cold, cruel world with a great many bad
      men in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could possibly have delighted Redell more. Whenever Cappy stabbed
      him, forthwith he set about to stab Cappy in return, and thus had
      developed a joyous business feud. These best of friends spent an hour and
      a half daily, at luncheon, &ldquo;picking&rdquo; on each other, telling tales on each
      other, eternally &ldquo;joshing&rdquo; for the edification of a coterie of their
      lumber and shipping friends who always lunched in a private dining room at
      the Commercial Club and who were known within that organization as the
      Bilgewater Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1915 Redell had seen an opportunity for inducing Cappy Ricks to
      speculate in grape stakes&mdash;to his financial hurt and humiliation.
      There was to be an election that fall&mdash;a special election to see
      whether California should &ldquo;go dry&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay wet,&rdquo; and for some reason not
      quite apparent to Mr. Redell, a great many people believed the state would
      &ldquo;go dry.&rdquo; Among the people who so believed, Redell discovered, were the
      woodsmen who, during the winter of 1914, would, under normal conditions,
      have split from redwood trees sufficient grape stakes to support such new
      vineyards as would come into bearing in the fall of 1915. Fearing that
      there would be no market for their grape stakes when the making of wine
      should be prohibited by law, these woodsmen had made no effort to supply
      the demand; wherefore the Machiavellian J. Augustus Redell, taking
      advantage of Mr. Skinner's absence from the office of the Ricks mills,
      cleverly managed to inculcate in Cappy Ricks the idea that it would be a
      splendid and profitable venture if he, the said Cappy, should wade into
      the grape stake market and corner it. The idea appealed to the speculative
      part of the old gentleman's nature and he had gone to work in a hurry,
      only to discover, after he had accepted orders from the West Coast Trading
      Company for a great many carloads of grape stakes for future delivery,
      that, when the day of reckoning should come, he would not be enabled to
      pick up enough grape stakes to fill his orders, for the very sufficient
      reason that nobody had manufactured grape stakes for that year's market,
      and they were not available at any price!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a cruel blow and Cappy's weakness had been exposed without
      mercy to the members of the Bilgewater Club by Mr. Redell, who thereafter
      kept both eyes wide open, knowing that sooner or later Cappy would
      retaliate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retaliation was, of course, inevitable. Cappy realized this. For the first
      time in his career as a lumber and shipping king the sly old dog realized
      he had been out-thought, out-played, out-gamed and man-handled by a mere
      pup. And, though he had taken his beating like the rare old sport that he
      was, nevertheless the leaves of memory had a horrible habit of making a
      most melancholy rustling; and for two weeks, following his ignominious
      rout at the hands of J. Augustus Redell, Cappy's days and nights were
      entirely devoted to scheming ways and means of vengeance. Curiously
      enough, it was the West Coast Trading Company that accorded him the
      opportunity he craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having massacred Cappy in the grape-stake deal and established an
      unlimited credit thereby, the West Coast Lumber Company, per Senor Felipe
      Luiz Almeida, alias Live Wire Luiz, decided to purchase a little jag of
      spruce from the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company. Cappy Ricks looked at
      the proffered order, saw that it called for number one clear spruce, and
      promptly accepted it at a dollar under the market. He was to bring the
      spruce in to San Francisco on one of his own schooners, lay her alongside
      the <i>City of Panama</i> and discharge it into her, for delivery at
      Salina Cruz, Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy knew, of course, that Live Wire Luiz handled exclusively the West
      Coast Trading Company's Mexican, Central and South American business. He
      knew, also, that there were many points about the lumber business that the
      explosive little Peruvian had still to learn; so he decided to stab the
      West Coast Trading Company, through the innocent and trusting Senor
      Almeida, with a weapon he would not have dreamed of employing had J.
      Augustus Redell placed the order. Live Wire Luiz knew the Ricks Lumber
      &amp; Logging Company always sold its output on mill tally and inspection;
      that Cappy Ricks' grading rules were much fairer to his customers than
      those of his competitors; that when he contracted to deliver number one
      clear spruce he would deliver exactly that and challenge anybody to pick a
      number two board out of the lot. But what Live Wire Luiz did not know was
      that there are two kinds of number one spruce on the Pacific Coast. One
      grows in California and the other in Oregon and Washington&mdash;and Cappy
      Ricks had both kinds for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Cappy murmured as he glanced over Live Wire Luiz's order after the
      latter had gone. &ldquo;Number one clear spruce, eh? All right, sir! Away down
      in my wicked heart I know you want some nice number one stock from our
      Washington mill, at Port Hadlock; but unfortunately you have failed to
      stipulate it&mdash;so we'll slip you a little of the California product
      and teach you something you ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Cappy sent the order to his mill on Humboldt Bay, California.
      Though this plant manufactured redwood lumber almost exclusively, whenever
      the woods boss came across a nice spruce or bull-pine tree among the
      redwood he was wont to send it down to the mill, where it was sawed and
      set aside for trusting individuals like Live Wire Luiz. When seasoned this
      spruce was very good stock. Unfortunately, however, experts differ in
      their diagnosis of California spruce. There are those who will tell you it
      is not spruce, but a bastard fir; while others will tell you it is not
      fir, but a bastard spruce. Cappy Ricks had no definite ideas on the
      subject, for he didn't own enough of that kind of stumpage to grieve him.
      All he knew or cared was that when such outlawed stock was billed as
      spruce no judge or jury in the land could say it was fir; also, that in
      its green state it possessed an abominable odor!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber was delivered to the <i>City of Panama</i> in due course and,
      as Cappy had suspected, Live Wire Luiz failed to come down to her dock and
      take a smell. This was a privilege left intact for the consignee at Salina
      Cruz; and he, according to Mexican custom, which only demands a ghost of
      an excuse to seek a rebate, promptly wired a protest and declared himself
      swindled to the extent of five dollars a thousand feet, gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, having been similarly outraged once before, he demanded to know why
      he had been sent California spruce; whereupon Live Wire Luiz called up
      Cappy Ricks, abused him roundly and sent him a bill for six dollars a
      thousand, rebate! Unfortunately for the West Coast Trading Company,
      however, it had already discounted Cappy's invoice; so the latter could
      afford to stand pat&mdash;which he did.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after noon on the day of his small triumph over the West Coast
      Trading Company, Cappy Ricks bustled up California Street, bound for
      luncheon with the Bilgewater Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, of all days, Cappy would not have missed luncheon with the
      Bilgewater Club for a farm. As he breezed along there was a smile on his
      ruddy old face and a lilt in his kind old heart, for he was rehearsing his
      announcement to his youthful friends of how he had but recently tanned the
      hide of a brother! He almost laughed aloud as he pictured himself solemnly
      relating, in the presence of J. Augustus Redell and Live Wire Luiz, the
      tale of the ill-favored spruce, excusing his own mendacity the while on
      the ground that he wasn't a mind reader; that if the West Coast Lumber
      Company desired northern spruce they should have stipulated northern
      spruce; that, as alleged business men, it was high time they were made
      aware of the ancient principle of <i>caveat emptor</i>, which means, as
      every schoolboy knows, that the buyer must protect himself in the clinches
      and breakaways. And lastly, he planned to claim it the solemn duty of the
      aged to instruct the young and ignorant in the hard school of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge, therefore, of his disappointment when, on entering the lobby of the
      Merchants' Exchange Building, on the two top floors of which the
      Commercial Club is situated, he encountered Redell and Live Wire Luiz
      leaving the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The West Coast Trading Company had offices in the same building and, as
      Redell carried a plethoric suit case, while Live Wire Luiz followed with a
      small hand bag, Cappy realized they were bound for parts unknown. In
      consequence of which he realized he had rehearsed to no purpose his expose
      of the pair before the Bilgewater Club. He halted the partners and secured
      a firm grip on the lapel of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Running out on me, eh? By Judas Priest, I just
      knew you didn't dast to stay and hear me tell the boys about that spruce.
      Drat you! The next time you'll know the difference between attar of roses
      and California spruce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell put down his suit case, pulled out his watch, glanced at it and
      then at his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell him, Luiz?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Live Wire Luiz thereupon consulted his watch, scratched his ear and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of my heart, do you theenk eet ees safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. He isn't a bit dangerous, Luiz. He's lost all his teeth and all
      he can do now is sit and bay at the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Live Wire Luiz shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I theenk maybe so you are right, <i>amigo mio</i>. The steamer she will
      go to depart in half an hour, an' that ees not time for thees ol'
      high-binder to do somet'ing. Eet ees what you call one stiff li'l' order.
      I admit thees spruce bandit ees pretty smart, but&mdash;&rdquo; again Live Wire
      Luiz shrugged his expressive shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;he ees pretty ol', no? I
      theenk to myself he have lose&mdash;what you call heem? ah, yes, he have
      lose hees punch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear he has, Luiz; so I'll tell him. At least the knowledge will gravel
      him and take all the joy out of that stinking little spruce swindle of
      his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twon't neither!&rdquo; Gappy challenged. &ldquo;I stung you there&mdash;drat your
      picture!&mdash;and I'm glad I did it. I rejoice in my wickedness. Cost you
      five hundred dollars for making a monkey out of the old man in that
      grape-stake deal, Gus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Redell wonderingly, &ldquo;I thought you'd forgiven me that, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have; but I haven't forgotten. Expect me to lose my self-respect and
      forget about it? No, sir! When I go into a deal and emerge in the red, I
      take a look at my loss-and-gain account and forget it; but when I'm
      ravished of my self&mdash;respect-wow! Look out below and get out from
      under! In-fer-nal young scoundrel! If I don't show you two before I die
      that I haven't lost my punch I'll come back from the grave to ha'nt you.
      Go on and spin your little tale, Augus-tus. You can't tell me anything
      that'll make me mad. What you got on your mind besides your hair, Gus? Out
      with it, boy; out with it! I'm listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cappy came close to Redell and inclined his head close to the young
      fellow's breast; whereupon Redell put his lips close to Cappy's ear and
      answered hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to Papeete to bid in that sunken German steamer, <i>Valkyrie</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that all? Well, when you return from Papeete you're
      going to take another journey right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the bankruptcy court first, and then up to the Home for the
      Feeble-Minded. On the level, boy, you're overdue at the foolish farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take a chance, Cappy. All you old graybeards can do is sit on the
      fence and decry the efforts of the rising generation. You just croak and
      knock. Of course I admit that once on a time an opportunity couldn't fly
      by you so fast you wouldn't get some of the tail feathers; but that was a
      long time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and glanced at his partner. Sorrowfully Live Wire Luiz tapped
      his forehead with his brown, cigarette-stained forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senile decay!&rdquo; Redell murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure; I bet you, Mike!&rdquo; Live Wire Luiz answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wagged his head lugubriously, turned aside and affected to wipe away a
      vagrant tear with his salmon-colored silk handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Cappy rasped. &ldquo;This thing is getting personal. Never mind
      about my years, you pup. If my back is bent a trifle it's from carrying a
      load of experience and other people's mistakes. And never mind about my
      noodle! It may have a few knots and shakes in it, but they're tight and
      sound, and it's free of pitch pockets, wane and rotten streaks; so this
      old head grades as merchantable timber still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for your head, Gus, and that of this human firecracker with you, both
      have streaks of sap round the edges, and I'll prove it to you yet. No; on
      second thought I don't have to prove it. You've already done that
      yourself! You're going to Papeete to try to bid in the <i>Valkyrie</i>,
      and she's junk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly.&rdquo; Redell admitted. &ldquo;She's been under water about two years and I
      suppose the teredo have digested her upper works by now; but they can be
      rebuilt quickly and without a great deal of expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about her boilers? You'll have to retube them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so. I was talking with Captain Hippard, of the
      Morrison-Hippard Line. They had the steamer <i>Chinook</i> under water a
      year in Norton Sound, but they raised her and brought her to San Francisco
      under her own steam. You know, Cappy, it's the combination of water and
      air that makes iron and steel rust. It seems that when a boiler is under
      water and not exposed to the air it rusts very slowly; also, the rust is
      like a soft film&mdash;it doesn't pit and scale off in great flakes. And a
      couple of years under water will not do any appreciable damage to the <i>Valkyrie's</i>
      boilers. The <i>Chinook</i> is running yet, notwithstanding the fact that
      fifteen years ago she was submerged for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Cappy grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same condition, of course, holds true with regard to her hull, only
      more so,&rdquo; Redell continued. &ldquo;The paint will protect the hull perfectly. Of
      course if, after getting her up, she is permitted to lie exposed to the
      air, the soft film of rust will promptly harden and scale off and she'll
      go to glory in a few months. However, nothing like that will happen,
      because the minute she's up she'll be thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed and
      painted. Of course the asbestos cover will have peeled off her boilers,
      but even at that I'll bring her to San Francisco under her own steam.
      She'll just be ungodly hot below decks and a hog for coal until the
      boilers are re-covered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy sighed. He was not prepared to combat this argument, for he had a
      sneaking impression Redell was right. However, he returned undaunted to
      the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's shot full of holes,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has one hole through her, and when she's loaded light that hole is
      above water line. The wrecking vessel that goes down to salve her will
      have steel plates, tools and mechanics aboard, and new plates can be put
      in temporarily. And if that cannot be done those holes can be patched with
      planking and cemented over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right. Grant that. But think of her engines, Gus. Think of
      those fine, smooth bearings and polished steel rods all corroded and
      pitted by salt water. The water may not have a disastrous effect on the
      boilers and hull, but an engine can't stand any rust at all and still
      remain one hundred per cent efficient. I tell you I know, Gus. I had my <i>Amelia
      Ricks</i> submerged on Duxbury Reef for a week; then I hauled her off and
      she lay on the tide flats in Mission Bay another three weeks until I could
      patch her up and float her into the dry dock. Do you know what it cost me
      to make her engines over again? Thirteen thousand dollars, young man&mdash;and,
      at that, they're nothing to brag of now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right; but that's because you didn't employ a German engineer and
      tell him you were going to put the <i>Amelia Ricks</i> on Duxbury Reef.
      Are you familiar with the characteristics of German engineers, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy threw up both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm neutral, Gus. Between them and the French it's a case of heads I win,
      tails you lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Cappy. You're wrong. The Germans are a careful, thrifty,
      painstaking, systematic race, and the chief of the <i>Valkyrie</i> was the
      flower of the flock. When that little French gunboat captured her this
      chief engineer looked into the future and saw himself and the <i>Valkyrie</i>
      interned indefinitely&mdash;and he didn't like it. It just broke his heart
      to think of a stranger messing round among his engines; so the instant he
      got into Papeete and blew down his boilers he did a wise thing. He knew
      the war risk insurance would probably cover the <i>Valkyrie's</i> loss as
      a war prize, but there was a chance that her German owners might send one
      of their hyphenated brethren down to Papeete to buy her in the prize
      court; and if that happened the chief wanted them to have a good ship.
      Perhaps, also, he figured on getting his old job back after the war. At
      any rate he got out a barrel of fine heavy grease and slobbered up his
      engines for fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too much. Cappy Ricks was too fine a sport not to acknowledge a
      beating; he was too generous not to rejoice in a competitor's gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lucky, lucky scoundrel!&rdquo; he murmured in an awed voice. &ldquo;Not enough
      salt water will get through that grease to hurt those engines. Gus, how
      did you find this all out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can bet your whiskers, Cappy, I didn't depend on hearsay
      evidence and water-front reporters to dig it up for me. The minute I heard
      her sea cocks had been opened and that her funnels and masts were sticking
      up out of the harbor I concluded I was interested; so I sent Bill Jinks,
      of our office, down to Papeete to get me some first-hand information. The
      chief of the <i>Valkyrie</i> is interned there, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May mad dogs bite me! Why in the name of all that's sweet and holy didn't
      I have sense enough to do that?&rdquo; Cappy mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lose the punch!&rdquo; chirped Live Wire Luiz, and Cappy glared at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an honest vessel, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' what you s'pose she have in her?&rdquo; Live Wire Luiz demanded. &ldquo;Oh,
      notheeng very much, Senor Ricks. Just two t'ousand tons of phosphate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth ten or twelve dollars a ton, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' t'irteen hundred tons of the good coal to bring her to San Francisco,
      <i>Ai</i>, Santa Maria!&rdquo; Live Wire Luiz blew a kiss airily into space and
      added: &ldquo;I die weeth dee-light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't got her yet,&rdquo; Cappy snapped viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but we'll get her all right,&rdquo; Redell declared confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'll you get her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've only one real competitor to buck&mdash;an Australian steamship
      company. They're crazy to get her; and as there are no French bidders on
      this side of the world, naturally and in view of the present condition of
      world politics the French authorities in Papeete are pulling for the
      Britisher. Jinks is now in Papeete and I'm about to start for there at one
      o'clock. Two bids, Cappy; I'll be the dark horse and file my bid at the
      last minute, after I've sized up the lay of the land. But, before I do so,
      I'm going to take the representative of that Australian steamship company
      into my confidence and find out what he's going to bid. For instance, now,
      Cappy, if you were bidding against me, how high would you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a long way from nowhere,&rdquo; Cappy replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;It means
      sending a wrecking steamer down there with a lot of expert wreckers,
      divers, mechanics and carpenters; it means lumber for cofferdam and
      pontoons; it means donkey engines, cables, pumps, the stress of wind and
      wave&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lies in a protected cove, Cappy; the mean rise and fall of the tide,
      so close to the equator, is about eighteen inches, and the water is so
      clear you can always see what the divers are doing. Forget the stress of
      wind and wave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty thousand dollars would be my top figure if I were the Australian
      bidder,&rdquo; Cappy declared, and added to himself: &ldquo;But, as Alden P. Ricks,
      seventy-five might not stagger me in view of the present freight rates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I figured,&rdquo; Redell answered. &ldquo;She'll cost us two hundred
      thousand dollars before we get her in commission again. I figure the
      Australian people will not go over forty thousand dollars. They won't
      figure Jinks as a heavyweight. I told him to create the impression that he
      was a professional wrecker&mdash;a sort of fly-by-night junk dealer, who
      would buy the vessel if he could get her at a great bargain. Then I'll
      drop quietly into Papeete, and at the eleventh hour fifty-ninth minute
      I'll slip in a bid that will top the Australian's. If by any chance Jinks'
      bid should also top the Australian's I'll just forfeit the certified check
      for ten per cent of my bid, run out and leave the ship to Jinks, the next
      highest bidder. The chances are I'll make a few thousand dollars at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you purpose raising her&mdash;provided you are the successful
      bidder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she has four hatches and she lies on an even keel. I'll build a
      coffer dam on her deck round these four hatches and pump her out. If we
      have enough pumps we can pump her out faster than the water can leak in
      under the coffer dam. When I've lightened her somewhat I'll kick her into
      the shore, little by little, until she lies in shallow water with her
      bulwarks above the surface. Then I'll patch the holes in her, pump her out&mdash;and
      up she'll come, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that so glibly,&rdquo; Gappy growled, &ldquo;one would almost think you could
      whistle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't feel sore, Cappy. Do you know what a vessel of her age and class is
      worth nowadays? Well, I'll tell you. About sixty dollars a ton, dead
      weight capacity&mdash;and the <i>Valkyrie</i> can carry seven thousand
      tons; that's four hundred and twenty thousand dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can get her up,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I bid her in I'll get her up. Don't worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;It'll clean you of your bank roll to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Luiz and I aren't millionaires like you; so we'll just form a
      corporation and call it the S. S. Valkyrie Company and sell stock in our
      venture. I have you down right now for a ten-thousand-dollar subscription
      at the very least, though you can have more if you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; Cappy pleaded, &ldquo;if you bid that boat in for forty thousand dollars
      I'll give you ten thousand dollars for your bargain and reimburse you for
      all the expense you've been put to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make it&mdash;let me see&mdash;I'll make it twenty thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You waste your breath. She'll pay for herself the first year she's in
      commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll furnish the sinews of war, Gus, for a half interest in her. Let me
      add her to the Blue Star Fleet and you'll never regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Cappy; but Luiz and I are ambitious. We want to get into the
      steamship business ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I've offered to do the fair thing by you two lunatics,&rdquo; Cappy
      declared with a great air of finality. &ldquo;So now I'll deliver my ultimatum:
      I'm going to keep the <i>Valkyrie</i> and not give you two as much as one
      little piece of her. Yes, sir! I'm going to send a representative to
      Papeete and match you and that Australian chap for your shoe-strings. Gus,
      you know me! If I ever go after a thing and don't get it, the man that
      takes it away from me will know he's been in a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I know it, Cappy&mdash;which is why I kept this information
      carefully to myself. However, I guess you'll not get in on this good
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too late for the banquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one leetle hope ees left for you, Cappy Reeks,&rdquo; Senor Almeida
      asserted. &ldquo;The <i>Moana</i>, on which my good partner have engaged passage
      to-day, ees the last steamer which shall arrive to Papeete before the bids
      shall be open. The next steamer, Capitan Reeks ees arrive too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the <i>Moana</i> sails in just twenty-five minutes, Cappy. If
      you're thinking of sending a man down to bid against me you'll have to
      step lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks was now beside himself; this gentle, good-natured heckling had
      made of him a venerable Fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll cable my bid!&rdquo; he shrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you won't Cappy, for the reason that there is no cable to Tahiti.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll wireless it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can try that, Cappy. Unfortunately, however, the only wireless
      station in Tahiti is a little, old, one-cat-power set. It can receive your
      message, but it can't send one that will reach the nearest wireless
      station&mdash;and that's at Honolulu. And until the bank in Tahiti can
      confirm drafts by wireless I imagine it will not pay them on
      presentation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy surrendered. He couldn't stand any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Gus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good luck to you! If you get that vessel you'll
      deserve her, and when you're forming the S.S. Valkyrie Company I'll head
      the list of stock subscribers with a healthy little chunk. You know me,
      Gus! I'm the old bell mare in shipping circles; a lot of others will
      follow where I lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you the spruce deal, Cappy. You're an awful pirate; but, for
      all that, you're a grand piece of work. God bless you!&rdquo; And Redell put his
      arm round the old man affectionately. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, followed by Live Wire Luiz, who was going to the dock to see his
      partner aboard the <i>Moana</i>, Redell disappeared into California
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; Cappy soliloquized bitterly. &ldquo;I can't eat lunch now. One bite
      would choke me.&rdquo;

      And he turned toward the entrance to the Merchants' Exchange, being minded
      to enter a telephone booth and notify the Bilgewater Club he would not be
      present that day. As he walked through the gate into the Exchange,
      however, he was accosted by a heavy, florid-faced man carrying a thick
      woolen watch coat over his arm. This individual was Captain Aaron Porter,
      one of the San Francisco bar pilots, and he greeted Cappy with a
      respectful query after the old gentleman's health.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel very well,&rdquo; Cappy replied wearily. &ldquo;I'm getting old, captain&mdash;getting
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he noted the watch coat the pilot was carrying and decided
      subconsciously that there could be no connection between it and the sultry
      August weather prevailing at that moment; consequently it informed the
      observant Cappy, as plainly as if it had a tongue and had spoken, that
      Captain Aaron Porter expected shortly to be exposed to the chill northwest
      winds outside as he piloted a vessel to sea. In the manufacture of sheer
      inane conversation, therefore, Cappy tugged the coat and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to take a ship out this afternoon, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I'll be responsible for the <i>Moana</i> until we cross the
      Potato Patch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Moana!</i>&rdquo; Cappy cried, and pulled out his watch. &ldquo;You'd better
      be stepping lively, then. She sails at one, and you have twenty minutes to
      get to Greenwich Street Pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's no hurry, Mr. Ricks. She'll be delayed from half to
      three-quarters of an hour waiting for the Australian mail. The mail train
      from the East is late, and of course the <i>Moana</i> cannot sail till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me, captain,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks interrupted politely, &ldquo;but I've
      just thought of a very important matter. I must run and telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As J. Augustus Redell had just pointed out, twenty minutes was scarcely
      ample time in which to decide on the right emissary to send to Papeete,
      get into communication with the said individual and induce him to go. In
      addition, such a person would have to have time to pack some clothing;
      also, to procure a letter of credit at the bank and purchase a ticket, not
      to mention the time requisite to receive his instructions and get to the
      steamer's dock. But with almost an hour&mdash;well, a wide-awake man can
      accomplish much in an hour, and Cappy Ricks was a natural leader of
      forlorn hopes. In the brief interval required to accomplish the journey
      from the door of the Merchants' Exchange to a telephone booth a flock of
      bright ideas capered through Cappy's ingenious head like goats on a tin
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Main 2000!&rdquo; he barked, and in five seconds he had the connection. &ldquo;Put
      Skinner on the line!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy's own private exchange operator had the temerity to inform him that
      Mr. Skinner was out at luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The in-fer-nal scoundrel&mdash;just when I need him! Put Captain Matt
      Peasley on the line, and be quick about it. Matt! Matt, listen! This is
      the old man speaking. Get an earful of what I'm going to tell you now, and
      don't ask any questions&mdash;just obey! Do you remember that big German
      freighter&mdash;the Valkyrie&mdash;sunk in Papeete Harbor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a prize, Matt. I've just been given a low-down on her condition.
      Gus Redell is leaving on the <i>Moana</i> to bid her in at the government
      sale&mdash;the young scoundrel told me all about it and twitted me because
      we were asleep on the job and let the good thing get away from us. The <i>Moana's</i>
      supposed to sail at one o'clock, but the Eastern mail is late&mdash;she
      won't get away from the dock until about one-thirty; but when she does&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she does we'll have a man aboard her to beat Redell to the German
      steamer,&rdquo; Matt Peasley interrupted. &ldquo;I've got the message. Where are you,
      father-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Merchants' Exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You attend to the funds and I'll do the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; rasped Cappy Ricks. &ldquo;You're so headstrong, you'll jam
      things up yet if you don't listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll have to send somebody Redell doesn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't matter at all. Now, son, will you listen to me? I'll attend
      to the money and I'll also frame this entire deal. Is Miss Keenan in the
      office&mdash;you know&mdash;Skinner's stenographer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been wanting to go on a vacation. When I heard about it I asked her
      how she'd like a cruise to Alaska&mdash;remember we have the <i>Tillicum</i>
      leaving at six to-night for St. Michael's. She said that would be fine; so
      I gave her a pass and the owner's suite on the <i>Tillicum</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear. Her trunk was sent to the <i>Tillicum's</i> dock this morning
      and she has her suit case in the office. She planned to work today and go
      aboard the <i>Tillicum</i> after office hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then she's all ready lor a voyage to Tahiti. Have the private
      exchange operator phone our wharf office instantly and tell them to load
      Miss Keenan's trunk on the first wagon handy and rush it over to the <i>Moana</i>.
      Give Miss Keenan fifteen hundred dollars and tell her she's to go to
      Papeete. If she kicks about clothes tell her to get along with what she
      has and buy what she needs on arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited while Matt Peasley gave the necessary instructions to the
      exchange operator. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, sir. Miss Keenan will go. She'll be on her way in five
      minutes. I've told her to go aboard and buy her ticket from the purser or
      from the ticket agent at the gang plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine business! Now who else have we in our employ that I can send? I want
      a man&mdash;and a rattling smart one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike Murphy, the skipper of the <i>Narcissus</i>,&rdquo; Matt suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man! He's discharging at Union Street Wharf. Phone the
      wharfinger's office and tell him he'll not regret taking a message down to
      the dock to Captain Murphy. Murphy will probably be at lunch aboard. Tell
      the wharfinger to tell him to throw a few clothes into a suit case&mdash;that
      he's to go to Papeete on mighty important business&mdash;and to meet me at
      the head of Greenwich Street Dock at one-twenty, without fail, for his
      orders and his money. Having phoned these orders, Matt, take the office
      automobile and scorch to the water front to see that they're carried out.
      Take Miss Keenan with you. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cappy Ricks dashed out of the Merchants' Exchange as though the devil
      was at his heels walloping him at every jump. It was four blocks to the
      Marine National Bank, but the California Street cable car took him there
      in four minutes. Gasping and perspiring Cappy trotted into the cashier's
      office, where for ten precious seconds he stood, open-mouthed, unable to
      say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; the cashier greeted him, &ldquo;if you can't talk make
      signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy flapped his hands and made three rapid strokes with his index
      finger, like a motion-picture actor writing a twelve-line letter; then the
      words came in a veritable cascade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters of credit,&rdquo; he croaked-&ldquo;two.&rdquo; The cashier picked up a pencil and
      a scratch pad. &ldquo;One, twenty-five thousand, favor Michael J. Murphy; one,
      favor&mdash;oh, what in blue blazes is that girl's first name? Oh, dear!
      Oh, dear! I never heard her first name&mdash;she's just Miss Keenan. Oh,
      the devil! Call her Matilda&mdash;that's it&mdash;Matilda Keenan&mdash;fifty
      thousand dollars for her; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to be in a terrific hurry for them, Mr. Ricks, so I'll get
      them started immediately,&rdquo; the cashier interrupted, and turned his
      memorandum over to an underling, with instructions to give Mr. Ricks'
      letters of credit precedence over all other business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now write&mdash;check&mdash;your favor&mdash;seventy thousand. I'll sign
      it&mdash;hope Skinner has enough cash on deposit; if he hasn't&mdash;my
      personal note, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere trifle, Mr. Ricks. We will not worry over that.&rdquo; The cashier
      filled in the check and Cappy signed it with a trembling hand. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
       the cashier continued, &ldquo;we will have to have Miss Keenan and Mr. Murphy
      come to the bank to register their respective signatures&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; Cappy piped. &ldquo;Give me the cards and I'll have 'em write
      their signatures on them aboard the steamer and send them ashore by the
      pilot. None o' your efficiency monkey business, my son! I guarantee
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dashed to the telephone and yelled into the receiver: &ldquo;Taxicab!
      Taxicab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the cars belonging to the bank is at the curb, Mr. Ricks. The
      chauffeur will take you wherever you desire to go,&rdquo; the cashier suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; Again Cappy commenced to flap his hands. &ldquo;Stenographer&mdash;where's
      the stenographer? Oh, Judas Priest, nobody helps me! Bless your sweet
      heart, my dear, here you are, aren't you? Yes, and I'll not forget you for
      it either. No, no, no! No notes. Just stick piece of paper in the
      typewriter&mdash;now then! Ready! Dictation direct to machine. Er&mdash;ah!
      Harumph-h-h! Oh, suffering sailor! What's the name of the French bank in
      Papeete? I don't know. I'm a director and vice president of this infernal
      bank&mdash;and I don't know I'm alive! Man, man, I want it&mdash;a thing&mdash;a
      what-you-may-call-'em&mdash;a&mdash;Oh, the devil! Why do I deposit in
      this dratted bank? Eureka! I have it! I want a notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean an advice, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully boy! An advice. That's it. Holy mackerel, how I love a man that's
      fast on his feet! A notice to the bank in Papeete, Island of Tahiti, that
      you've given Captain Michael J. Murphy a letter of credit for twenty-five
      thousand dollars&mdash;only one notice for one letter of credit. I'm up to
      skullduggery. Man, man, why don't you dictate? Usual courtesies&mdash;good
      customer of your bank&mdash;you know; usual flubdub. No advice regarding
      Miss Keenan's letter of credit&mdash;just Murphy's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cashier good-naturedly shouldered Cappy Ricks aside and dictated to
      the bank's correspondent in Papeete a brief note to the effect that the
      Marine National had that day issued to Captain Michael J. Murphy a letter
      of credit in the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars; that it understood
      Captain Murphy was proceeding to Papeete on some matter of business and
      took this occasion to commend him to their kindly offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick that in an envelope&mdash;address envelope, seal it, and write
      outside: 'Kindness purser S.S. <i>Moana.</i>' The mail to Papeete is
      closed, but I'll see that the <i>Moana's</i> purser delivers it to the
      bank,&rdquo; Cappy ordered.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Cappy dashed up to the entrance of Greenwich Street Pier
      and found Matt Peasley waiting for him, with Captain Murphy. Miss Keenan
      had already gone aboard the <i>Moana</i>, the huge funnel of which, as
      Cappy noted with a thrill, was still sticking up over the roof of the
      dock. He crooked his finger and Michael J. Murphy leaped up on the running
      board of his car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; said Cappy solemnly, &ldquo;listen to me! Here's a letter of credit in
      your name for twenty-five thousand dollars, and an advice to the bank in
      Papeete from our bank here stating that the letter of credit has been
      issued. Give this letter to the purser, together with a good-sized bill,
      and ask him to deliver it to the Papeete bank when the <i>Moana</i>
      arrives there. Here, also, is a letter of credit for Miss Keenan in the
      sum of fifty thousand&mdash;and the bank in Papeete has no notice of it!
      Remember that! It's important. Keep it to yourself. Miss Keenan has the
      expense money for both of you; tell her to split the roll with you. Tell
      her, also, that her name from now until she gets back is Matilda Keenan,
      and to sign her drafts that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the signature cards. You sign yours and have her sign hers; then
      you give both to Captain Porter, the pilot, when he leaves the ship, and
      ask him to deliver them to me. I, in turn, will deliver them to the bank.
      Tell Miss Keenan she is absolutely under your orders; that she's to forget
      she ever heard of the lumber and shipping business. Both of you are to
      keep away from a man by the name of J. Augustus Redell. He's aboard and
      he's our enemy, captain. He's going to bid forty thousand dollars on the
      German steamer <i>Valkyrie</i>; so you bid forty thousand and five dollars&mdash;and
      take her away from him. At the very last minute have Miss Keenan put in a
      bid for thirty thousand&mdash;in case&mdash;you know, Mike&mdash;we might
      catch it going and coming. It might pay to have you fall down on your bid&mdash;you
      know, Mike! She's the dark horse&mdash;the reserve capital. Papeete&mdash;one-horse
      town, Mike. Everybody knows the other fellow's business&mdash;principal
      competitor for the steamer is an Australian steamship company. Considering
      condition world politics today, and no French bidders, naturally Frenchmen
      will pull for the Britisher. Expect bank will leak and tell 'em you only
      arrived with twenty-five thousand&mdash;you know, Mike! Can't be too
      careful. Trust nobody&mdash;and remember this man Redell is the smartest
      young man in the world and the trickiest scoundrel under heaven. Don't
      hold him cheap. He's a holy terror! He'd pinch the gold out of your wisdom
      teeth while you'd be laughing at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How high am I to go&mdash;if it becomes necessary to bid more than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot the piece!&rdquo; Cappy ordered. It is to be regretted that the
      Bilgewater Club, cut off from the house rules in a private dining room,
      had a habit of shooting craps occasionally after luncheon, and Cappy Ricks
      had picked up the patois of the game. &ldquo;Seventy-five thousand is the limit;
      but satisfy yourself she's worth the limit before you go to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Redell is going to bid forty thousand, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's his limit. He told me so in confidence when he felt certain I
      couldn't possibly be a competitor&mdash;told it to me, and kidded me for a
      dead one at twenty minutes of one, when he knew I couldn't possibly have
      time to act. But he forgot the mail&mdash;it was delayed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get you, sir. There's more to this job than merely acquiring the ship,&rdquo;
       retorted the astute Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a million dollars' worth of satisfaction in it for me if I can
      beat Gus Redell to that steamer. He says I've lost my punch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Murphy was off down the dock, suit case in hand, while Cappy
      dismissed his borrowed car and climbed into the office car with Matt
      Peasley. Five minutes they waited at the head of the dock&mdash;and then
      four huge motor trucks, laden with mail, lumbered through the dock gate.
      Cappy beamed into Captain Matt Peasley's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess this is a rotten day's work for the president emeritus, eh?&rdquo; he
      chuckled. &ldquo;President emeritus! By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, if I waited
      for you and Skinner to get wise to all the good things that are lying
      round loose, the Blue Star Navigation Company would be in the hands of a
      receiver within the year. Matt, if you expect to manage the Blue Star
      you'll have to wake up. You're slow, boy&mdash;s-l-o-w-w! For heaven's
      sake, don't force me back into the harness! You know I've been wanting to
      retire for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, our messengers are aboard, so let's get out of here. I'm hungry; I
      haven't had any lunch,&rdquo; Matt replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; Cappy answered cheerfully, &ldquo;I believe I could eat a
      little something myself. However, I still have one small duty to perform,
      Matthew. I've got to send a wireless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That scoundrel Redell, of course. Think I'm going to swat him and leave
      him in ignorance of the fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately upon arrival at the Commercial Club, Cappy sent the following
      message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J. Augustus Redell,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboard S. S. <i>Moana</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augustus, my dear young friend, I have known men who grew rich by keeping
      their mouths closed!
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;CAPPY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Cappy, as he dispatched this simple declarative sentence.
      &ldquo;I'll wager one small five-cent bag of smoking tobacco our friend Gus
      Redell will not sleep to-night. He'll just lie awake wondering what in Sam
      Hill I meant by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he got back to his office he found an aerogram, which read as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden P. Ricks
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;258 California Street
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;San Francisco
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything lovely. After getting aboard decided to bluff; went to Redell,
      told him I was your representative. He went green clear back of the ears;
      said he had observed delay in sailing. Told him he'd better quit and go
      ashore with pilot; that I had bank roll choke hippopotamus. Your wireless
      handed him that moment! Would hesitate repeat his language. Have agreed
      pay him for his first-class ticket. All first-class cabins sold out; had
      to have it for Matilda. Steerage an awful place for a skipper, but will
      have to make the best of it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;MUHPHY.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner, alarmed at the shrill screams emanating from Cappy Ricks'
      office, rushed in and found the president emeritus rolling round in his
      swivel chair, beating the air and stamping on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Mr. Ricks!&rdquo; Skinner cried. &ldquo;What's the matter? Are you
      hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;Hurt? Well, I should say so! Skinner, my boy, if
      you ever lose your punch you'll know just how much I'm suffering. As Live
      Wire Luiz would say: 'I die weeth dee-light!'&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      Three months later Cappy Ricks sat alone in his office, his feet on his
      desk, his old head bowed on his breast. Apparently he was having a gentle
      snooze. Suddenly he sat up with the suddenness of a jack-in-the-box and
      stepped to the door leading to Mr. Skinner's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember that stinking Humboldt
      spruce I sawed off on Live Wire Luiz one day when you were out to lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner nodded.

      &ldquo;They claimed a rebate of six dollars a thousand on it,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and
      we declined to allow the claim. Well, I've decided to allow it, Skinner.
      Tell Hankins to draw a check for the rebate in full and bring it in to me.
      Send in a stenographer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy clawed his whiskers as the stenographer took her seat at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! Hum! Harumph-h-h!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Take letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. J. Augustus Redell
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;President West Coast Trading Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merchants' Exchange Building, City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Gus: Having waited for several weeks in the hope of meeting you
      at the Bilgewater Club, to which, due to some mysterious reason, you
      appear to have been excessively disloyal of late, I despair of the delight
      of a personal interview and am accordingly writing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will recall that jag of odoriferous spruce your excitable partner was
      chump enough to buy from the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company. On the
      receipt this morning of a communication from my exceedingly capable
      representative in Papeete I came to the conclusion that I could afford to
      allow the rebate claimed by the excessively sour-balled Senor Almeida, and
      accordingly I am inclosing herewith, to the order of your company, the
      Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company's check for $536.12.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also beg to tender you my assurance that if I have seemed in the past
      to cherish an unchristian resentment of that little deal in grape stakes,
      the memory of the outrage no longer rankles in my bosom. For you, my dear
      young friend, I entertain the kindliest, the most paternal of feelings. I
      have not only forgiven, but I have also forgotten; for my honor is clear
      again and I figure I can pretty blamed well afford myself the luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regarding that steamer <i>Valkyrie</i>, please be advised that the next
      steamer to Australia, via Papeete and Raratonga, will carry a Blue Star
      flag and my instructions to our representative to have it tacked to the
      main truck of the <i>Valkyrie</i> as she dies submerged in the harbor.
      Since I assume you will be interested in learning the details of our
      acquisition of the steamer in question, and since, further, I cannot see
      that I have anything to lose by withholding this interesting information,
      please be advised that we bought her in for twenty-two thousand five
      hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you will be inclined to doubt this and accuse me of romancing for
      the purpose of dropping more salt in a wound still fresh and bleeding; but
      I assure you such a suspicion would be a grave injustice to an old man
      whose portion from you should be pity, not opprobrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin, it was very easy&mdash;after we had you out of the way. Like a
      sensible man, you knew you were licked and threw up the sponge to save
      yourself unnecessary punishment. It has been my experience that only a
      very wise man has sense enough to do that; consequently, despite your
      youth and impetuosity, I seem to see the glimmer of a very brilliant
      commercial future for the West Coast Trading Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, to the story: When Mike Murphy got down to Papeete he found a
      couple of broken-down junk dealers hanging round&mdash;the kind of fellows
      who would have been glad to bid in the vessel at a couple of thousand
      dollars for the privilege of breaking her up for junk and gutting her of
      her cargo. A little reflection convinced Captain Murphy that he could
      eliminate these small fry and centre his attention on the Australian
      steamship company; and he was aided in arriving at this conclusion by your
      Mr. Jinks, whom he found glooming at the dock on the arrival of the <i>Moana</i>
      minus your handsome self. By the way, Mr. Jinks' action in aiding and
      abetting Murphy, after discovering that his own company was out of the
      running, was so sportsmanlike that, if you will kindly advise me of the
      expense to which you were put in sending him to Papeete, we will gladly
      send you our check to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took the capable Murphy about an hour and a half to get the lay of the
      land&mdash;and then he started to play his little game. In the rather
      restricted society of Papeete Murphy played the fool. Every little while
      he would apparently acquire a small jag and get very confidential. He told
      everybody his business&mdash;in confidence&mdash;and everybody in Papeete
      knew just how much he was going to bid on the wreck. Finally, the day
      before the bids were to be opened&mdash;Murphy was waiting till the last
      minute before filing his&mdash;the captain of the port got a wireless from
      some adventurer down in Noumea, asking him to withhold the opening of the
      bids till he could get up to Papeete and make a bid. Murphy had already
      fooled away three weeks in Papeete and if the captain of the port
      hearkened to the request from the man from Noumea it would mean a wait of
      another three weeks. Consequently he awaited the next move with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Augustus, the captain of the port had the temerity to delay the
      opening of the bids, and Murphy noticed that his competitor hired an
      attorney and made a bitter and formal protest against the delay. However,
      it looked to Murphy like they had made just a little bit too much noise&mdash;so
      he hired an attorney and made a lot of noise himself. The captain of the
      port overruled both protests, however; and about that time Murphy decided
      to put over a dirty Irish trick. He announced he could see very clearly
      there was a move on to double-cross the legitimate bidders and that he
      wasn't going to hang round any longer. The <i>Timaru</i> was due the next
      day, so he and Jinks engaged passage to San Francisco on her; and, just
      before he left, Murphy went up to the bank and drew eighteen thousand
      dollars on his letter of credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got a certificate of deposit in his own name, and that same afternoon
      his attorney filed a sealed bid with the captain of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I had suspected there might be a leak from that French bank in favor
      of the Australian; so I had taken care to have it advised by the Marine
      National here that the latter bank had issued a letter of credit for
      twenty-five thousand dollars to Captain Murphy. Therefore, the Papeete
      bank very naturally concluded that twenty-five thousand dollars was all
      the money Murphy had with him! And when he drew eighteen thousand dollars
      on it they thought they knew the exact amount of his bid; they thought,
      also, he had made a bid, in view of the fact that his attorney filed one
      the same afternoon. At any rate, the news reached the Australian and he
      withdrew his bid and substituted another. Since he was the possessor of
      straight inside information as to the amount of his single competitor's
      bid, he saw no reason why he should waste money; so he bid four thousand
      pounds, or approximately nineteen thousand five hundred dollars. They say
      he felt pretty sore when the bids were opened and the <i>Valkyrie</i> went
      to Miss Matilda Keenan for twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Keenan, by the way, is Skinner's stenographer. Murphy was only the
      decoy. She carried the real bank roll and nobody suspected her; in fact,
      Murphy was so certain of his prey he didn't even bid! He tells me the <i>Valkyrie</i>
      is really a gift, and that, at the widest possible estimate of salvage
      cost, the Blue Star Navigation Company has purchased, for two hundred
      thousand dollars, a four-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar ship&mdash;thanks
      to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With kindest regards, and again assuring you of the pleasure I have
      always taken in our friendship&mdash;a friendship which, I trust, nothing
      will ever disrupt&mdash;I am
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cordially and sincerely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy paused and gazed at the stenographer appraisingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that over again, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl complied and Cappy nodded his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Mr. Skinner get along all right?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad to hear that. You've been substituting for Miss Keenan,
      haven't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can have the job for keeps if you want it. You suit me. Take
      letter: 'Miss M. Keenan&mdash;' I called her Matilda, but her name's Mary;
      so let it go at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Keenan: Captain Murphy arrived on the <i>Timaru</i>, with
      the information that he had taken a chance and left our affairs in the
      laps of the gods and the capable hands of his understudy. It has been
      pretty tough sledding waiting for the next Australian steamer, but, thank
      God! she made port yesterday and your report of the success of your
      mission is before me. I thank you. Yen're a good girl, and I am very happy
      to learn of your engagement to Captain Murphy. He is a splendid fellow and
      I am sending him back to Papeete in command of our <i>Amelia Ricks</i>,
      which has been fitted up as a wrecker, to raise the <i>Valkyrie</i>. You
      had better wait in Papeete and marry him there, as I am opposed to long
      engagements among my employees; and Michael will do better and faster work
      if he settles all his personal worries before tackling those of the Blue
      Star Navigation Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his return with the <i>Valkyrie</i> I shall make him port captain of
      the Blue Star Fleet, which job will keep him home nights. And since, by
      his ingenuity, he succeeded in purchasing for twenty-two thousand five
      hundred dollars a piece of property for which I was prepared to pay as
      high as seventy-five thousand dollars, for your wedding present I shall
      allot you and Captain Murphy a ten-thousand-dollar piece of the <i>Valkyrie</i>.
      It should earn you thirty per cent and make you independent in your old
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sincerely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks ceased dictating and clawed his whiskers reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured irrelevantly; &ldquo;I guess that's considerable of a
      knock-out from an old fogy who's lost his punch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, to the stenographer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be all, my dear. As you pass through the general office tell
      those fellows out there that I've gone into executive session with myself
      and am not to be disturbed unless it's something very important. I've got
      to decide which one of our skippers to promote into the <i>Valkyrie</i>
      when we get her up and I must think up a new name for her. I think I'll
      call her the J. H. Skinner. Skinner's a little slow on his feet, but he
      means well and he's old enough to have a ship named after him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The practical theft from the West Coast Trading Company of the German
      steamer <i>Valkyrie</i>, had, to Cappy's mind, atoned for the loss and
      humiliation he had suffered in that grape stake deal. His honor was clean
      again and for weeks he taunted Redell with the latter's inefficiency,
      insufficiency and general business debility, until, having extracted the
      last shred of triumph from the affair, a vague sympathy for Redell
      commenced to surge up in Cappy's kindly heart and he commenced casting
      about for an opportunity to do the former a favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redell had enjoyed his beating, for he was, indeed, a rare sport. However,
      he would have to retaliate. The feud must go on. Unless he could mix a
      modicum of fun with his profits, J. Augustus would not have regarded the
      fight worth while, so accordingly he kept his eyes and his ears open for a
      handy weapon with which to jab Cappy through that same old rift in his
      armor&mdash;his passion for a large profit through an adroit and ingenious
      deal in a commodity where even a very modest profit was not discernible to
      ordinary mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Redell found the opportunity he sought. He was so proud of his
      formula that he could not forbear remarking casually to Live Wire Luiz one
      bright day that, granted good health and the approval of Providence for
      one week, he would knock Cappy Ricks for a goal. And he narrated his
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of my heart!&rdquo; the little Peruvian cried excitedly, and held out
      his arms to Redell, inviting a fraternal embrace. &ldquo;I love you! Damn eet! I
      say eet! You are one wezard weeth the money-making schemes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redell cautiously compromised on a hearty handshake; to avoid a kiss
      he was careful to keep the table between himself and Live Wire Luiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we empty the corporate sock and climb aboard for every cent we can
      beg, borrow or steal?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I bet you!&rdquo; Live Wire Luiz cried; for, though a featherweight
      physically, he was possessed of the courage of an Alexander.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell put on his hat, took from a pigeonhole in his desk the
      last trial balance of the West Coast Trading Company's books and departed
      for a conference with his banker. Half an hour later he returned, and the
      expectant Luiz promptly noted a cloud on Mr. Redell's sunny countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't arrange for a loan,&rdquo; he reported disgustedly. &ldquo;The limit, in view
      of our present obligations, has been reached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the margin of ten cents,&rdquo; suggested Live Wire Luiz, &ldquo;take a chance, <i>amigo</i>.
      Thees is not speculation. It ees what you call the ceench weeth the copper
      reevets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I figure it that way; nevertheless, copper-riveted cinches sometimes
      aren't properly cinched and Fortune backs out of the packsaddle. I dare
      not take a long chance on this, Luiz. If something went wrong we'd be
      sadly embarrassed. We dare not take a chance up to the limit of what money
      we have on hand, because we need those funds for other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Live Wire Luiz swore mournfully in Spanish. Redell nodded and retired to
      his own office, where for an hour he sat with his head in his hands,
      searching his agile brain for a bright idea that would lead him out of his
      dilemma. Suddenly he leaped to his feet, tossed his hat to the ceiling and
      caught it again as it came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy Ricks is my meat,&rdquo; he declared aloud. &ldquo;Besides, I owe Cappy one for
      making a monkey out of me on that last deal. He hoisted me on my own
      petard. Now I'll hoist him, and incidentally annex a profit for the West
      Coast Trading Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed out into California Street and for the major portion of the day
      was very busy among various shipping offices. When he returned, late in
      the afternoon, to the offices of the West Coast Trading Company, his alert
      young face wore a pleased and confident smile. Live Wire Luiz noted this
      and took heart of hope.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks was, for the thousandth time since his voluntary retirement
      from active business some ten years previous, overwhelmed with his ancient
      responsibilities. Mr. Skinner had, under the insistent prodding of his
      wife, consented grudgingly to a vacation and had gone up into the Sierras
      to loaf and fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Skinner departed when one of the Blue Star steamers ran
      ashore on the Southern California coast, and Captain Matt Peasley left
      immediately for the scene of the disaster to superintend the work of
      floating the stranded vessel. This left Cappy riding herd on the destinies
      of the Blue Star ships, with Mr. Hankins, Skinner's understudy, looking
      after the lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to boarding the train, Matt Peasley had ventured the suggestion that
      Mr. Skinner be ordered by wire to return to town at once; but this veiled
      hint that the Blue Star ships could not be managed by the man who had
      built up the Blue Star Navigation Company had been received very coldly by
      the president emeritus of the Ricks interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young feller,&rdquo; Cappy informed his son-in-law testily, &ldquo;I'll have you know
      I was managing the Blue Star Navigation Company quite some years before
      you quit wearing pinafores; so I guess, while you and Skinner are away
      from the office, we can manage to stagger along after a fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't like to have you worried with business after you've retired&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retired!&rdquo; Cappy hooted. &ldquo;Swell chance I've got to retire! I'll die in the
      harness whether I want to or not. Tut, tut, my boy! Don't be afraid to put
      me in as a pinch hitter for this organization. The worst I can do is to
      single&mdash;and I might clout a home run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Skinner has been away two weeks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! It would be a bad thing to obsess Skinner with the notion that we
      can't get along without him. Then he never would take a rest; and I don't
      want any martyrs or neurasthenics round my office. You got anything on the
      fire that's liable to burn or boil over, before you get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to worry about, Cappy,&rdquo; Matt answered. &ldquo;Our five-masted schooner
      <i>Mindoro</i> is the only vessel requiring immediate attention. She
      arrived at Sydney yesterday with lumber from Gray's Harbor, and as yet I
      haven't been able to get a satisfactory return cargo for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been holding out for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get a cargo for delivery in San Francisco if possible. The
      vessel will be ready to go on dry dock by the time she gets back here; and
      besides, I'm planning to put a semi-Diesel-type engine in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Not by a jugful! She wasn't built with a shaft log, and I won't have you
      weakening my <i>Mindoro</i> by cutting away her deadwood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tish! Tush! You're a back number, Cappy. They don't cut through the
      deadwood any more. They run the shaft out over her quarter and hang it on
      struts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll carry a helm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll not; but if she does, let her. It'll give the helmsman something
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy subsided, fearful that if he persisted he might be given new
      evidence of the fact that times had changed a trifle, here and there,
      since he had&mdash;ostensibly&mdash;gone on the retired list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll take care of the <i>Mindoro</i>,&rdquo; he assured his son-in-law.
      &ldquo;Early in life I adopted the woodpecker as my patron saint. Ever since,
      whenever I want anything I keep pecking away, and pretty soon I bust
      through somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, bursting with a sense of responsibility, Cappy came
      bustling down to the office and got on the job at eight-thirty. After
      looking through the mail he called up all the freight brokers in town and
      urged them to make a special effort to line up a San Francisco cargo for
      the <i>Mindoro</i>; then he summoned Mr. Skinner's stenographer and was
      busy dictating when Mr. J. Augustus Redell was announced by a youth from
      the general office. Cappy went to the door to welcome his beloved young
      friend and business enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Gus, my dear boy,&rdquo; he chirped, &ldquo;and rest your face and hands.&rdquo;
       He turned to the stenographer. &ldquo;That will be all, my dear, for the
      present. I can't dictate business secrets in the presence of this&mdash;ahem&mdash;harumph-h-h!&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His desk telephone rang. Cappy took down the receiver and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J. O. Heyfuss &amp; Co. are calling you, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; his private exchange
      operator announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy smiled and nodded. J. O. Heyfuss &amp; Co. were ship, freight and
      marine insurance brokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something doing for my <i>Mindoro</i>,&rdquo; he soliloquized aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ricks?&rdquo; a voice came over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; Cappy replied at the top of his voice. For some reason he
      always shouted when telephoning. &ldquo;Ricks on the job! Whatja got for my <i>Mindoro</i>,
      Heyfuss?... Zinc ore? Never carried any before. Don't know what it looks
      like.... Yes; that freight rate is acceptable. We should have more, but
      God forbid that we should be considered human hogs... Yes.... Sure it's
      for discharge in San Francisco? ... All right. Close for it....
      Good-bye!... Hey there, Heyfuss! Don't close in a hurry. See if you can't
      get the charterers to pay the towage over to her loading port. If they
      won't pay all, strike 'em for half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hung up without saying good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's out of the way,&rdquo; he declared with satisfaction. &ldquo;Just closed
      for a cargo of zinc ore from Australia to San Francisco ex our schooner <i>Mindoro</i>.
      Matt Peasley's been hunting wild-eyed for a cargo for her&mdash;scouring
      the market, Gus&mdash;and nothing doing! And here the old master comes
      along and digs up a cargo while you'd be saying Jack Robinson. By the Holy
      Pink-Toed Prophet, if you can show me how the rising generation is going
      to get by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused suddenly, leaned forward, and pointed an accusing finger at his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; he charged, &ldquo;you're up to something. I can see it in your eyes. You
      look guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redell hitched his chair close to Cappy and with his index finger
      tapped the old gentleman three times on the right knee-three impressive
      taps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alden P. Ricks,&rdquo; he began with equal impressiveness, &ldquo;I have a scheme&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy chuckled and slapped his thin old thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it! By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet! Gus, if you ever come into my
      office and fail to unload a scheme on me I'll think you aren't enjoying
      your usual robust health. What are you going to start now? A skunk farm
      for cornering the market on Russian sable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut out the hilarity. This is serious business, Cappy. I can show you
      where you and I can waltz into the Chicago Pit, make a killing on December
      wheat, and escape with a sizable wad before our identity is discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy, caught off his guard, blinked at the enormity of the prospect; but,
      remembering his dignity as a business man, he shook his head sadly and
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheat! Wheat, eh? A lumber and shipping man monkeying with wheat? Not for
      little old Alden P. Ricks! No, sir! When I go speculating I stick to my
      specialties&mdash;lumber and ships. Did you ever hear of a gambler,
      winning a fortune at faro, who didn't drop his winnings on the ponies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a beautiful layout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about wheat and I'm too old to learn. Besides, I
      don't trust you, Gus. You're an infernal scoundrel; and experience has
      taught me that any time I take your tip and go in on a deal I have to step
      lively to keep from being walked on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this time I'm free from guile. I won't stab you, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use! The last boat just left, Augustus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration with caption: He always shouted when telephoning.}
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redell, however, was made of rather stern stuff. He was a young man
      who never took &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer. Persistence was his most striking
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;Let the dead past bury itself. I give you my
      word of honor, Cappy, that this deal is on the level. Just let me put all
      my cards on the table while you take a look; then, if you don't want to
      come in, all I ask is your word of honor that you'll stay out while I
      round up a partner with red blood in his veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy pricked up his ears at that. He saw that Redell was serious; he knew
      that once the latter passed his word of honor he never broke it. Still,
      Cappy did not wish to appear precipitate in his surrender; so he said
      weakly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am against speculation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you're against foolish speculation,&rdquo; Redell corrected him. &ldquo;I
      take it, however, that you have no objection to playing a sure thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Gappy admitted, &ldquo;in that event I might be persuaded. Nevertheless,
      I'm afraid of you. There's a fly in the ointment, even if I cannot see it.
      You owe me a poke, and you'll never rest until you've squared the account
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redell held up his hands in abject distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;don't say that. You wrong me cruelly. It is in my
      power to stand idly by and let you assimilate a poke right now; but, just
      to show you I haven't any hard feelings, I'll do something nice for you
      instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll save you money&mdash;not only today but for years to come; and I'll
      save your self-respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call up J. O. Heyfuss &amp; Co. and tell them to take their cargo of zinc
      ore in bulk for your schooner <i>Mindoro</i> and go to the devil with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good gracious, boy, I have to get something for her homeward trip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this case nothing is better than something. Do you know anything about
      zinc ore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; as much as an Eskimo knows about the doctrine of
      transubstantiation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. Well, I'll enlighten you. Zinc ore is blamed near as heavy
      as lead, and it's as fine as cement. Load it in a ship in bulk and, what
      with the pitching and rolling of a vessel on a long voyage, she opens up
      every seam and crack in her interior; then this powdered ore sifts into
      the skin of the ship and down into her bilge, and you'll never be able to
      get it out without tearing the ship apart. Why, after a vessel has
      freighted a cargo of zinc ore there may be as much as fifty tons left in
      her after she's supposed to be discharged; and, of course, thereafter
      she'll carry that much less cargo than she did before. Besides, the
      consignees are liable to send you a bill for the shortage; you can gamble
      your head they'll deduct it from the freight bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy sailor!&rdquo; Cappy was appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Redell continued, &ldquo;I'm surprised at your ignorance, Cappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm amazed at your intelligence! Where did you get all this zinc-ore
      dope?&rdquo; Cappy challenged. &ldquo;How do you know it's true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it from Captain Matt Peasley. I heard him give it to J. O. Heyfuss
      on the floor of the Merchants' Exchange two weeks ago, when Heyfuss tried
      to sneak up on his blind side and hang that cargo of zinc ore on him. I
      guess they weren't importing much zinc ore when you were active in
      business, Cappy, or you'd have known all about it. You see the plot, don't
      you? As soon as Heyfuss learned that Matt Peasley and Skinner had gone
      away, leaving a defenseless old man on the job, he organized himself to
      spear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shameless son of a sea cook! By gravy, Gus, you're my friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need any more proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a speck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll give you some. Call up Heyfuss and declare that ore cargo off;
      after you've done that I'll tell you where you can get something better.
      Moreover, you can close the deal yourself and save the brokerage.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks called up J. O. Heyfuss and in a few terse sentences told that
      individual where to head in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then&mdash;&rdquo; he began, facing round on Redell once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Redell's index finger tapped Cappy's knee. Dramatically he
      pronounced a single word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of wheat?&rdquo; In his amazement Cappy was rather helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number One white Australian wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jibbering jackdaw! Wheat? Don't you know blamed well that wheat is
      one of the commodities Australia never exports to these United States?
      Why? Because we don't need her doggoned wheat! We grow all the wheat we
      need and a lot more we don't need; we export that, and it's just as fine
      wheat as you'll find anywhere. Moreover, any time our crop is a failure,
      our next-door neighbor, Canada, is Johnny-on-the-spot, ready to make
      prompt delivery. So what in thunder are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer J. Augustus Redell drew from his pocket that morning's paper
      and pointed to the headline of a front-page story. Cappy adjusted his
      spectacles and read: Bakers Announce Six-Cent Loaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo; said Cappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! And it's a smaller loaf, by the way. Doesn't that argue that
      there is something doing in wheat, when the price of bread goes to six
      cents for a half portion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there might be something in that, Gus. Crack along and tell me some
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the identity of the real culprits is fixed, Cappy, we must blame
      the war in Europe for the six-cent loaf; likewise for the fifteen-dollar
      shoe that formerly cost our wives six or seven; for the eleven pounds of
      sugar for a dollar, when twenty to twenty-two pounds was the standard in
      the good old days. Europe is too busy fighting to pay much attention to
      farming; the wheat farmers of Canada are somewhere in France instead of
      being at home 'tending to business; and it has been up to Uncle Sam and
      the Argentine Republic to feed the world, you might say. Naturally
      speculators have seized upon this condition to shoot the price of wheat to
      the skies, and in desperation the millers have been casting about to buy
      cheaper wheat. Investigation discloses the fact that Australia has an
      enormous quantity of wheat on hand; some of it is the surplus of the 1915
      crop. Of course she has exported all she could to England; but, at that,
      she has been handicapped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because when a ship sails from Liverpool with goods for Australia, it is
      a rare case when that same ship promptly loads with Australian goods and
      puts back to Liverpool. She takes a cargo of coal, say, from Newcastle up
      to Manila; a general cargo from Manila to Seattle or San Francisco; thence
      to a West Coast port with a general cargo; thence to New York with
      nitrate; thence to Europe with foodstuffs or munitions. Australia hasn't
      had the tonnage to export her wheat and it's been piling up on her. Now
      they've simply got to sell something to get some ready money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is perfectly re-markable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell took a document from his pocket and gravely handed it to Cappy, who
      examined it and discovered the same to be a charter party, consummated the
      day before between the West Coast Trading Company, owners of the
      barkentine <i>Mazeppa</i>, and Messrs. Ford &amp; Carter, a well known
      export and import firm whose principal business was done in grain. Cappy
      read the charter party carefully and even verified the signatures, with
      which he was familiar. The vessel was to carry a cargo of wheat from
      Melbourne to San Francisco at a freight rate that fairly shrieked the word
      &ldquo;Dividend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Re-markable!&rdquo; Cappy declared. &ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing is believing. Call up Ford &amp; Carter, and they'll jump over
      themselves to give you a cargo of wheat for your <i>Mindoro</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Im-possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm telling you. Why, it stands to reason, Cappy! Canada and the
      United States are so much nearer Europe than is Australia that it has been
      cheaper to use our wheat, and the result is we've been cleaned out; and
      the newspapers are filled with dismal stories of the sufferings of the
      poor due to the increased price of bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, Gus, there <i>has</i> been a lot of that stuff in
      the papers lately. But, of course, when a fellow's stomach is full and he
      isn't in danger of being attached for debt, he never thinks of the less
      fortunate brother. Yes, Gus, I dare say the demand for our wheat now
      exceeds the visible supply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any wonder, then, that this condition of affairs should come to the
      attention of the Australian exporters? Just because Australian wheat has
      never been shipped into the United States is no reason why it shouldn't be
      shipped&mdash;particularly when the price of flour goes up daily. Why, we
      pay two and a half dollars for the fifty-pound sack of flour that formerly
      cost us a dollar and a quarter! Eggs are up to seventy cents a dozen&mdash;by
      jingo, Cappy, what's going to become of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; Cappy answered dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redell had him hypnotized. Already Cappy could see the gates of the
      poorhouse opening to receive them all. Redell's voice brought him back to
      a realization of his peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find, Cappy Ricks, that for months to come every sailing vessel
      that carries lumber to Australia from the Pacific Coast will come back
      with a cargo of wheat while these war prices are maintained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Jumping Jehoshaphat! How'd you get next to all this, Gus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The early bird gets the worm, and success comes to the man who creates
      his own opportunities. I thought it all up out of my own head, Cappy, and
      then tried it out on Ford &amp; Carter. It knocked 'em cold for a minute;
      but that was only because the proposition was so unusual. When I explained
      the situation to them, however, and gave them time to digest it, both
      offered to take me out to luncheon. You can see for yourself they've
      chartered our Mazeppa at a fancy freight rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy licked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Mindoro</i> is sound, tight and seaworthy,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She
      could carry wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in, Cappy. The water's fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it! Gus, you're a mighty good fellow, if I do say it that
      shouldn't. I have five windjammers en route to Australia this minute, and,
      by the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, if I can get wheat charters for all of them
      on the return trip I'll accept, if it costs me money. Gus, something has
      got to be done about this high cost of living or we'll all go to hell
      together. There comes a time in a man's life when he must put aside the
      sordid question of 'How much is there in it for me?' and ask himself: 'How
      much can I put in it for the other fellow?' Gus, it's our Christian duty
      to furnish tonnage to import this wheat. We should, as patriotic citizens,
      make it our business to boom Australian wheat in the United States and
      give these doggoned pirates that gamble in the foodstuffs of the country a
      run for their money. Food prices should be regulated by this Government.
      The Chicago Pit should be abolished by legislative enactment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they won't do it this year, Cappy,&rdquo; Redell interrupted dryly.
      &ldquo;Still, it occurred to me that I saw an opening where two high-minded
      philanthropists&mdash;to wit, Alden P. Ricks and J. Augustus Redell&mdash;might
      strike a blow for freedom and at the same time give these wheat
      speculators a kick where it will do them the most good. When one cannot
      annihilate his enemy the next best thing is to take some money away from
      him; and you and I, Cappy Ricks, can take a young fortune away from these
      fellows, while at the same time depressing the price of wheat and doing
      our fellow countrymen a favor. Are you prepared to volunteer under my
      banner? If so, hold up your right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy held up his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it, Gus,&rdquo; he ordered; &ldquo;out with it! This is most interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You're interested now, are you? Well, bearing in mind the fact that
      your specialty is lumber and ships, I will give you an opportunity to
      withdraw before it is too late. Besides, it occurs to me that I have
      already done enough for you today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be greedy, Gus. Remember there is an exception to every rule.
      Besides, I'm getting old and&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!&mdash;hell's bells, boy,
      I've got to have my fling every once in a while. Come now, Gus! Out with
      it! I believe your proposition embodied the coupling of both our names in
      the betting, did it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did, Cappy. Still, come to think of it, I really ought not to come in
      here and tempt you into speculating&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money do you want?&rdquo; Cappy shrilled impatiently. &ldquo;Cut out this
      infernal drivel and get down to business. Unfold your proposition; and if
      it looks to me like a winner I'll take a flyer with you if it's the last
      act of my sinful life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your own head be it, Cappy. Here goes! However, before laying my plan
      before you, perfect frankness compels me to state that my visit to you was
      not born of an overweening desire to do you a kindness or make money for
      you. Philanthropy is not my long suit&mdash;in business hours; and my
      interest in you today is purely a selfish one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on; go on, boy! Am I a child in arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a ball, Cappy,&rdquo; Redell continued, &ldquo;and I want you to fire it.
      I have a splendid prescription to make a clean-up in December wheat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your prescription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, my prescription lacks one small ingredient to make it a
      standard household remedy. You can supply that ingredient&mdash;to wit,
      cash of the present standard of weight and fineness. Every spare dollar
      that Live Wire Luiz and I can get our hands on is working overtime in the
      legitimate business of the West Coast Trading Company; every loose asset
      with a hockable value has been hocked, and we dare not strain our credit
      with our banker by borrowing money with which to speculate. If I apply for
      a sizable loan, without putting up collateral, he'll ask me what I want to
      do with the money&mdash;and if I answer truthfully he'll throw Luiz and me
      and our account out of his bank. And I never was a very successful liar.
      Therefore, in consideration of the valuable information I can furnish, I
      suggest that you carry me for a quarter of a million bushels of December
      wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will that cost me?&rdquo; Cappy queried warily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll operate on margin. I think a margin of ten cents a bushel will do
      the trick; of course, if wheat should go up a point you'll be asked to
      come through with more money. However, I have a sneaking notion that a
      well-known heavyweight like you can place his order with any of the local
      brokers without having to put up a single cent; at the most they might ask
      you for five thousand or ten thousand dollars. But they know you're good
      for any engagement you may make; they'd be tickled to death to have your
      promissory note. I suggest that you get in touch with a sound brokerage
      house in this city&mdash;one that is a member of the New York Exchange and
      the Chicago Board of Trade&mdash;and sell, for my account, two hundred and
      fifty thousand bushels of December wheat at the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll I do for myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go as far as you like. You know your own limitations. I'm desirous of
      selling a quarter of a million bushels at the market; and, as I am
      furnishing the plans and specifications for this raid, I suggest that you
      sell at least a quarter of a million yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny business!&rdquo; Cappy murmured. &ldquo;Selling a quarter of a million bushels
      of wheat you do not own and never will! Hum-m-m! Ahem! Harumph-h-h! Then
      what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head and gazed very severely at Mr. Redell over the rims of
      his spectacles. For reply Mr. Redell took from his pocket thirteen sheaves
      of paper and handed them to Cappy, who investigated and discovered them to
      be thirteen forty-eight-hour options on thirteen sailing vessels bound to
      Australian ports with lumber, and not as yet provided with a return cargo
      to the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By to-morrow morning I shall have exercised those options and closed for
      thirteen cargoes of wheat,&rdquo; Redell explained. &ldquo;You have five vessels bound
      to Australia also. Give me an option on them for their return cargo and
      that will make eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will charter all of the eighteen to Ford grain of it, in order to
      protect themselves against a falling market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. And the market is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December wheat closed in the Chicago Pit yesterday at $1.89 1/2, and the
      market has been very stiff for quite a while. The bulls are right on the
      job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not the advent of all this Australian wheat depress the market?&rdquo;
       Cappy shrilled excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless the bears happen to find it out, Cappy,&rdquo; Redell retorted
      gently. &ldquo;It is our job to bring the matter to their attention, for it so
      happens that Alden P. Ricks and J. Augustus Redell are the only two people
      in the United States who happen to know about it. Ford bulls will get
      panicky; the bears will take heart of hope, and with Number One white
      Australian wheat they'll beat the brains out of the market and in all
      probability kick it down to $1.85, at which figure we promptly buy as much
      wheat as we have previously sold. Thus we cover our shorts, and the
      difference between $1.89 1/2 and $1.85, less brokerage and interest&mdash;if
      any&mdash;will be, roughly speaking, four cents. Four cents on a quarter
      of a million bushels is ten thousand dollars&mdash;not a great deal,
      truly, in these days of swollen fortunes, but, nevertheless, a nice piece
      of velvet&mdash;eh, Cappy, you sporty boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so much the money we make,&rdquo; Cappy replied sagely. &ldquo;It's the fun
      we have making it, my boy; the joy of putting over a winner. The instant a
      man begins to love money for money's sake he's a knave and a fool. Kill
      him! But&mdash;er&mdash;ahem&mdash;as you say, my dear young friend, ten
      thousand each is not to be&mdash;er&mdash;sneezed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're coming in on the deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should tell a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the fashion of the West they shook hands on it and went to luncheon
      at the Commercial Club.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Directly luncheon was over and Cappy Ricks had returned to his office, J.
      Augustus Redell moved into action. He called on Messrs. Ford &amp; Carter,
      talked the situation over with them, and showed them where they, having
      the necessary tonnage in hand with which to guarantee delivery, could
      bring a couple of million bushels of fine Number One white Australian
      wheat to the Pacific Coast, cut the price a cent, and doubtless unload
      every kernel of it at a fair profit. There was every probability that
      wheat would go to two dollars. For his part in producing this profit Mr.
      Redell desired a commission of five per cent on all sales of wheat
      imported in the bottoms he had under option and which he stood ready to
      turn over to Ford &amp; Carter without profit, since the owners of the
      vessels would pay him the customary broker's commission on the freight
      money earned on the voyage. Ford &amp; Carter said they would think the
      matter over; so Mr. Redell tactfully withdrew, stating that he would call
      up the following day for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew Ford &amp; Carter would promptly dispatch a long cablegram to
      their agent in Australia, instructing him to get a forty-eight-hour option
      on the wheat, with a guaranty of delivery to the vessels as they arrived
      from time to time. Meantime, Ford &amp; Carter would quote every milling
      company in the West, subject to prior acceptance and their ability to
      deliver Number One Australian wheat at a price that would be of interest.
      If the milling companies accepted this rather nebulous quotation and
      telegraphed orders, and Ford &amp; Carter's Australian agent could
      purchase at a satisfactory price the wheat to fill these orders, then Ford
      &amp; Carter would make formal acceptance and purchase the wheat. If, on
      the other hand, their agent in Australia failed to get the wheat, then
      Ford &amp; Carter had an &ldquo;out&rdquo; with the milling companies who desired to
      buy the wheat from them, and the entire matter would be off, with Ford
      &amp; Carter merely out a couple of hundred dollars in telegraph bills.
      That was the bet they had to make to put their fortune to the touch; and
      right cheerfully did they make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell gave them all the time he could. His forty-eight-hour
      options on the vessels then en route to Australia had cost him nothing;
      that was a courtesy which one shipowner always extends to another, free of
      charge, unless the vessel happens to be on demurrage at the time the
      option is given. When his options were within two hours of expiring he
      called on Ford &amp; Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take 'em all,&rdquo; Carter almost shouted at him. &ldquo;They'll be arriving
      with sufficient time elapsing between arrivals to guarantee us immunity
      from any undue delay or embarrassment in loading them. We've bought the
      wheat and sold it; now give us the tonnage to freight it, Redell, and
      we'll all be happy, and a little richer than we were the day before
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell took up the telephone and called each shipowner, in turn, to inform
      him that he would exercise his option on the latter's ship, and for the
      owner to prepare charter parties and send them up to his office for
      signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have no difficulty in getting the owners to agree to an assignment
      of these charters to you,&rdquo; he advised Carter. &ldquo;You and Ford are brothers
      in good standing, I take it. However, if they insist on doing business
      through me, in order that they may hold me responsible, I'll simply
      recharter to you at the same rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; cried Messrs. Ford &amp; Carter in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later J. Augustus Redell burst into Cappy Ricks' sanctum and
      wakened the old gentleman from his afternoon siesta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trap is set,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Come on, Cappy! We're going up to the
      broker's office now and give the order to sell our December wheat. I can't
      go alone, you know. There wouldn't be an odor of sanctity about the
      transaction if I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have Gregg &amp; Company attend to it for us,&rdquo; Cappy announced.
      &ldquo;You remember Harry Gregg, don't you? Used to be in the steamship business
      years ago. Gosh, that boy knows me! He'll take a stiff finger bet from
      Alden P. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they motored uptown to the office of Gregg &amp; Co., where
      Cappy's card gained him instant admittance to the broker's private office.
      Redell remained in the anteroom on pretense of speaking to an
      acquaintance, and the instant Cappy disappeared into Gregg's office Redell
      stepped out into the hall, where he waited until Cappy had booked his
      order and came hunting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've sold my two hundred and fifty thousand bushels at a
      dollar-ninety,&rdquo; Cappy announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much margin?&rdquo; Redell demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gregg didn't sting me very hard. Ten cents a bushel. It seemed like a
      good bet to him. He looks for a drop in December wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met a pest out here and couldn't seem to get away from him,&rdquo; Redell
      explained. &ldquo;Take me in and introduce me to Gregg, and I'll give him an
      order to sell a jag of wheat for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy complied and Redell gave the broker his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take about twenty-five thousand dollars to margin this trade, Mr.
      Redell,&rdquo; the latter remarked easily as he wrote out the order and handed a
      copy to Redell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Cappy struck in. &ldquo;Mr. Redell is one of our most delightful,
      trustworthy and popular young men, and to ask him for twenty-five thousand
      dollars today would prejudice his standing with his banker. I guarantee
      him, Harry. Treat him as you'd treat me. I guarantee him up to a hundred
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your guaranty goes with me, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Gregg answered promptly, and
      shoved the copy of the order he had just booked over to Cappy, together
      with the fountain pen. Cappy wrote: &ldquo;O. K. Alden P. Ricks.&rdquo; Redell gave
      his check for ten thousand dollars margin and the deal was closed. When
      the scheming pair returned to Cappy's office the latter gave Redell his
      check for ten thousand to reimburse Redell for margining the trade, in
      accordance with Cappy's verbal agreement to provide the sinews of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Cappy,&rdquo; Redell announced as he stuffed Cappy's check into his
      pocket, &ldquo;the next move is to return to my office, close those charters
      with the owners and turn the ships over to Ford &amp; Carter. That matter
      attended to, I shall, with eighteen charter parties in my pocket, drift
      casually over to the Merchants' Exchange. There I shall find the market
      reporters for both of our sunrise sheets; if they are not there I shall
      wait until they arrive. These gifted young men I shall draw to one side;
      to them I shall, with great gusto, relate a tale of Number One white
      Australian wheat, shortly to descend upon the United States of America in
      no less than eighteen vessels, now chartered for that purpose, with more
      to follow. In proof of this statement I shall exhibit the charter parties;
      and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-page story!&rdquo; Cappy declared, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;but soon. To get on the front page a story must be rather
      unusual. A perusal of our daily rags will convince the most skeptical that
      the sensational, the unusual, the bizarre are what appeal most to the men
      who make the newspapers. The unusual thing about our deal lies in the fact
      that this is the first time in the history of Australia or the United
      States that the former country has exported wheat into the latter&mdash;the
      first time the latter has ever had to call on an outsider for help. Then,
      Cappy, it will be a front-page story&mdash;and how those boys will hop to
      it! Why, we'll get a column about Australian wheat invading the land of
      the free whose rapacity threatens the very food that goes into the mouths
      of little children! Little children and their mouths is good stuff! I'll
      use that line when slipping the story to the boys. They might overlook it
      if I didn't. I'll remind them of the six-cent loaf of bread, the
      sufferings of the poor, and how far the importation of Australian wheat
      will go to knock the Chicago wheat barons for a goal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here! You're too precipitate,&rdquo; Cappy cautioned. &ldquo;Don't tip this
      story off to both reporters. That's coarse work. Tell it to one only. Put
      him under obligations to you by seeming to give him a scoop. Tell him you
      won't say a word to his competitor, and he'll tell his city editor the
      story is exclusive; then they'll be certain to play it up big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy, you're the shadow of a rock in a weary land! Who'll tip off the
      other reporter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, of course. Leave it to me. A man doesn't go through the mill of
      Big Business without knowing the way of that singularly useful individual,
      the newspaper man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell sat down and laughed until the tears ran down his merry
      countenance. Cappy thought the outlook sufficiently cheerful to warrant
      that laugh, and suspected nothing. He even joined in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-morrow morning, when that story appears, the local brokerage firms
      will be calling up Ford friend and gave him a paternal hug. He winked
      wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;suppose you and I go out and pin one on?
      Hey? How about you, boy? A pint of '98, in order that we may properly
      drink confusion to the wolf of want and damnation to dull care!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon Cappy Ricks graciously summoned the Chronicle reporter
      to his office and told him in detail all he knew about the Australian
      wheat invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this may be mere street gossip; but I think
      there's something in it, my boy. At any rate, I thought you might care to
      be tipped off to the situation. It looks like a corking story to me. I
      suggest that you call up Ford &amp; Carter and see what they have to say
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether the Examiner reporter has a tip on this?&rdquo; the Chronicle
      man queried hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from me. This story is for you, young man. That's why I called you
      down to my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the same hour J. Augustus Redell might have been seen at the press
      table on 'Change, unfolding a similar story to the market reporter of the
      Examiner, who thought it was a humdinger of a story, and so declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Glad you think so,&rdquo; Mr. Redell replied, beaming upon him. &ldquo;And
      just to show you I'm right, I'll not breathe a word of it to the Chronicle
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having planted his journalistic bomb, Mr. Redell glanced at his watch. It
      was exactly eleven o'clock. &ldquo;I still have time,&rdquo; he murmured, and departed
      immediately to the office of Gregg of December wheat, but to cease selling
      the instant the market hesitated to absorb it or the price broke a point.
      At the same moment, in another brokerage office, Cappy Ricks was issuing a
      similar order. Before the market closed, Cappy had succeeded in selling a
      hundred and eighty thousand bushels, while Redell had disposed of a
      hundred and thirty. Evidently the bears took it as it came, for the market
      closed strong at $1.89.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Cappy nor Redell reported at his office the following day. At the
      hour when the market opened in Chicago both schemers appeared on the floor
      of the Merchants' Exchange and bent their gaze upon the only blackboard on
      'Change they had not heretofore honored with their scrutiny&mdash;the
      board in back of the Grain Pit, which carried the quotations on the
      Chicago Board of Trade, already beginning to come in by wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour the trading was inactive. Then suddenly the price broke half a
      point as somebody tossed a lot of fifty thousand bushels on the market.
      Cappy and Redell each wondered whether he might not be the responsible
      party; and while they pondered somebody unloaded a hundred thousand
      bushels at $1.88. Cappy gasped as the quotations appeared on the
      blackboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something doing, Gus!&rdquo; he whispered; Redell nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now commenced a period of wild trading. The price crept back to $1.89,
      only to be assaulted and beaten back to $1.87; then, fraction by fraction
      and point by point, the price fell; and J. Augustus Redell wagged his head
      approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have received our message,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The riot is on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the price had been beaten down to $1.83 Cappy turned to his
      associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm through!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Time to cover my shorts.&rdquo; And he trotted away to
      a telephone booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Redell, he would not intrust his fortune to a telephonic order, but
      sprang into 'his runabout, parked at the curb outside the Exchange, and
      scorched uptown to Gregg &amp; Co.'s offices, where he learned that he had
      sold four hundred and ten thousand bushels of December wheat. One hundred
      thousand had been sold at $1.90, two hundred and eighty thousand at prices
      varying from $1.89 to $1.88 1/8, and the remainder at 1.88.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy me four hundred and ten thousand bushels at the market,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left the office the sale had been confirmed and Mr. Redell's
      shorts had been covered at a price ranging from $1.83 to $1.83 5/8,
      whereupon he closed out his trade and received a check for his margin and
      his profits. An hour later he met Cappy Ricks again on 'Change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cappy?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cleaned up, thank you,&rdquo; the old gentleman informed him. &ldquo;Sold, bought,
      and got the money. This is one time it rained duck soup and I was there
      with a bucket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He prodded Mr. Redell playfully in the short ribs and the incident was
      closed. They had made a profit of more than twenty thousand dollars each;
      and when each returned to his office he forgot all about December wheat
      until half past five that evening, when both met on the deserted floor of
      the exchange to scan the blackboard. December wheat had closed that day at
      $1.83! Two days later J. Augustus Redell called Cappy Ricks on the
      telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Redell speaking. Read the story on the front page of the Chronicle this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; what was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The British Government has placed an embargo on the exportation of wheat
      from Australia; so all those eighteen charters I negotiated with Ford were
      placed with Ford &amp; Carter subject to Ford &amp; Carter's ability to
      make delivery and to prior sale. Before Ford &amp; Carter could make them
      firm orders and get in over their heads, I tipped them off to the
      possibility of this government embargo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tipped them off! How did you know the British Government was going to
      clap an embargo on Australian wheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I didn't know,&rdquo; Redell confessed. &ldquo;I just guessed it would; so I
      advised Ford than I did&mdash;and I made a trifle more than twenty-four
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? Well, listen to me tell it; When you and I cashed in that day
      our deal was closed wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd played fair with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did, Gus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I was freed from any further obligations to take you into
      partnership with me, was I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how I figure it, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how I figured it also, Cappy. Consequently, being morally certain
      that the British Government would place an embargo on the exportation of
      Australian wheat&mdash;Cappy, you must admit that the British Government
      would have been absolutely crazy if it hadn't&mdash;I just called on Gregg
      &amp; Co. and bought another half million bushels of December wheat at
      $1.83 to $1.84 a bushel. Then I sat tight and waited for that embargo
      story to break. Cappy, do you know that story just raised hell on the
      Chicago Pit today? The bears were caught napping; and the bulls got busy
      and kicked the price up to $1.90 again, at which figure I unloaded and
      took my profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amazing rascal! Why didn't you tip your partner off to that deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were no longer partners. You admitted that a moment ago. When I first
      outlined this scheme I didn't have a dollar to spare with which I could
      speculate. Every last cent was tied up in the business of the West Coast
      Trading Company. So I schemed to take you in as a partner on one-half of
      the deal; and you not only financed me but guaranteed me to the broker!
      Your introduction was all I wanted. After that my credit was as good as
      December wheat; in consequence of which, without a cent invested, I was
      actually enabled to carry a trade for half a million bushels! Much obliged
      to you, Cappy. You're a fine old sport, and I like you&mdash;I wouldn't be
      surprised if you laid off on me after this&mdash;eh, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; said Cappy Ricks, &ldquo;one of these days the Democratic party is going
      to wake up and discover that America isn't where they left it the night
      before! And when that happens they're going to ask you about it, you&mdash;you&mdash;infer-nal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phone clicked. J. Augustus Redell had hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drat it!&mdash;God bless him!&rdquo; murmured Cappy Ricks&mdash;and hung up,
      too.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whenever Cappy Ricks made up his mind that his Blue Star Navigation
      Company ought to add another vessel to its rapidly growing fleet, he
      preferred to build her; for a few bitter experiences early in life had
      convinced him that the man who buys the other fellow's ship quite
      frequently is given a bonus in the shape of the other fellow's troubles&mdash;troubles
      which have the unhappy faculty of tilting the profit-and-loss account over
      into the red-ink figures. In order to avoid these troubles, therefore,
      Cappy would summon his naval architect, whom he would practically drive to
      distraction by fussing over the plans submitted before giving a final
      grudging acceptance. The blue prints approved, Cappy would spend a week
      picking holes in the specifications, and when there was no more fault to
      find Mr. Skinner, his general manager and the president of the Ricks
      Lumber &amp; Logging Company, would send a list of the timbers, planking,
      and so on required, to one of Cappy's sawmills in Washington; for Cappy
      had a theory&mdash;the good Lord knows why or where acquired&mdash;that
      Douglas fir from the state of Washington was better for shipbuilding
      purposes than Douglas fir grown in Oregon. Perhaps he figured that the
      Columbia River, which separates the two states, made a difference in
      grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods boss would then be adjured to select his trees with great care.
      No tree would do that sprouted a limb within eighty feet of the butt, and
      the butt had to be at least six feet in diameter, in order that it might
      produce fine, clear, long-length planks that would not contain &ldquo;heart&rdquo;
       timber&mdash;the heart of a log having a tendency to check or split when
      seasoned. When the material was sawed a Blue Star steam schooner would
      transport it to San Francisco Bay, and it would be stored in Cappy's
      retail lumber yard in Oakland, to be seasoned and air-dried; following
      which Cappy Ricks would let the contract for the building of the vessel to
      a shipyard on Oakland Estuary, and sell the builder this seasoned stock at
      the price of rough green material, even though it was worth two dollars a
      thousand extra&mdash;not to mention the additional value for the
      extra-long lengths furnished specially. Cappy's ancestors, back in Maine,
      had built too many ships to have failed to impress upon him the wisdom of
      this course; for, on this point at least, initial extravagance inevitably
      develops into ultimate economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the laying of the keel, Cappy would come out of retirement and
      become an extremely busy man. He had the vessel's engines to consider; and
      for two weeks his private office would resound with the arguments and
      recriminations of Cappy and his port engineer. There would be much talk of
      pistons, displacement of cylinders, stroke, reciprocating engines, steeple
      compound and triple-expansion engines, Scotch boilers, winches,
      compressors, dynamos, composition and iron propellers and the latest
      developments in crude-oil burners. And on the day when the port engineer,
      grown desperate because of the old man's opposition to some detail, would
      fly into a rage and resign, Cappy would know that, at last, everything was
      all right; whereupon he would scornfully reject the resignation and take
      his port engineer to luncheon at the Commercial Club, just to show he
      wasn't harboring a grudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the port captain would be making daily visits to the
      shipyard to make certain that the builder was holding rigidly to the
      specifications and not trying to skimp here and there; and on Saturdays
      Cappy would accompany him and satisfy himself that the port captain wasn't
      being imposed upon. Finally the ship would be launched; and as she slid
      down the ways Cappy Ricks would be standing on her forecastle head, his
      old heart fluttering in his thirty-six-inch chest and his coat-tails
      fluttering in the breeze, one arm round the port captain and the other
      round the port engineer. As the hull slipped into the drink he would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, this is the life! I love it! By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, there's
      more romance in ships than you'll find in most married lives!&rdquo; Then he
      would wave an arm up Oakland Estuary, which prior to the great war was the
      graveyard of Pacific Coast shipping, and say with great pride: &ldquo;Well,
      we've done a good job on this craft, boys; she'll never end in Rotten Row!
      Every sliver in her is air-dried and seasoned. That's the stuff! Build 'em
      of unseasoned material and dry rot develops the first year; in five years
      they're punk inside, and then&mdash;some fine day they're posted as
      missing at Lloyd's. Did you ever see a Blue Star ship lying in Rotten Row?
      No; you bet you didn't&mdash;and you never will! I never built a cheap
      boat and I never ran 'em cheap. By gravy, the Blue Star ships are like the
      Blue Nose that owns 'em! They'll be found dead on the job!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite early in 1915 the Blue Star Navigation Company had found ample
      opportunity, due to a world scarcity of tonnage, to dispose of several of
      their oldest and smallest steam schooners at unbelievably fine prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get rid of them, Matt,&rdquo; Cappy advised his son-in-law, Captain Matt
      Peasley, whom he had made president of the company. &ldquo;You have the
      permission of the president emeritus to go as far as you like. Big boats
      for us from now on, boy. Slip the little ones while the slipping is good.
      These high prices will not prevail very long&mdash;only while the war
      continues; and at the rate they're slaughtering each other over in France
      the war will be over in six months; then prices will fall kerflump! Then
      we'll build a couple of real steamers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Matt Peasley promptly sold five steam schooners, following which he
      made up his mind that the world still had two years of war ahead of it.
      Accordingly he urged the letting of contracts for two
      seven-thousand-five-hundred-ton steel freighters immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; Cappy declared. &ldquo;Why, it's rank nonsense to think of
      building now at wartime prices. If our recent sales have pinched us for
      tonnage we'll have to charter from our neighbors and worry along as best
      we can until the war is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're making a mistake, Cappy Ricks,&rdquo; his son-in-law warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Skinner if I am. Skinner, let's have your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner, always cautious and ultra-conservative promptly advised
      against Matt Peasley's course; but Matt would not be downed without a
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know prices for ship construction are fearfully high just now,&rdquo; he
      admitted; &ldquo;but&mdash;mark my words!&mdash;they're going to double; and if
      we place our contracts now, while we have an opportunity to do so, we'll
      be getting in on the ground floor. I tell you that war hasn't really
      started yet; and the longer it continues the higher will prices on all
      commodities soar&mdash;but principally on ship construction.
      Father-in-law, I beg of you to let me get busy and build. Suppose the
      boats do cost us a quarter of a million dollars more each than we could
      have built them for in 1914. What of it? We have the money&mdash;and if we
      didn't have it we could borrow it. I don't care what a ship costs me when
      freight rates are soaring to meet the advance in construction costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Cappy and Mr. Skinner hooted him down. Three months later,
      however, when Cappy Ricks had changed his mind, and Mr. Skinner was too
      heartbroken to curse himself for a purblind idiot, it was too late to
      place the contracts. Every shipyard in the United States and abroad was
      loaded up with building orders for three years in advance, and the Blue
      Star Navigation Company was left to twiddle its corporate thumbs. Matt
      Peasley was so angry that he almost speculated on the delight of being at
      sea again, in command of a square rigger, with Cappy Ricks and Mr. Skinner
      signed on as A.B.'s; in which condition of servitude he might dare to call
      them aft and knock their heads together. However, he managed to have his
      revenge. Every time nitrate freights went up a dollar a ton he told them
      about it with great gusto, and the day he chartered the <i>Tillicum</i>
      for Vladivostok, with steel for the Russian Government at seventy-five
      dollars a ton, he had poor Cappy moaning in his wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think how nice it would be,&rdquo; he taunted his aged relative, &ldquo;if we
      had only placed contracts for two big boats when I urged it. By the middle
      of summer I'd have them both on the Vladivostok run&mdash;perhaps at a
      hundred dollars a ton; and long before the war is over you could do what
      you've been trying to do for the past ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Cappy queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retire!&rdquo; Matt retorted meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In-fernal young scoundrel!&rdquo; Cappy was angry enough to commit murder. &ldquo;Out
      of my office!&rdquo; he shrilled, and pointed to the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV
    </h2>
    <p>
      For once in his busy life it was, figuratively speaking, raining duck
      soup, and poor Cappy was there with a fork! When he had recovered his
      composure he sent for Matt Peasley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, my dear boy,&rdquo; he confessed miserably, &ldquo;this is certainly one
      occasion upon which father appears to have overlooked his hand. However,
      none of us is perfect; and if we're caught out without an umbrella, so to
      speak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo; Matt reminded him witheringly. &ldquo;Cappy, it's all right to use that
      'we' stuff when you're talking to Skinner, but trot out the perpendicular
      pronoun when you're talking to me. I hate to say 'I told you so'; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay off me!&rdquo; Cappy pleaded. &ldquo;I'm an old man, Matt; so be easy on me.
      Besides, I don't make a mistake very often, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know it. But when you blocked me on that building scheme you
      certainly made up for lost time. Really, Cappy, you mustn't make me play
      so close to my vest in these brisk times. If I'm to manage the Blue Star
      Navigation Company I mustn't have my ideas pooh-poohed as if I were a
      hare-brained child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Matt; I know. But I built up the Blue Star Navigation Company and
      the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company by playing 'em close, and it's a
      hard habit to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, let us forget the past and look forward with confidence to the
      future. Matt, my dear boy, since we cannot get a shipyard to build a
      steamer for us, I'm going to break a rule of forty years' standing and buy
      one in the open market. I guess that'll prove to you I'm not so hide-bound
      with conservatism as you think. Go forth into the highways and the byways,
      Matt, and see what they have for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How high do you want me to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As high as they hung Haman&mdash;if you find it necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's certainly a free hand; but I'm afraid it comes too late. I doubt
      if there is an owner with the kind of steamer we want who is crazy enough
      to sell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tish! Tush! All things are for sale all the time. Scour the market, Matt,
      and you'll find Cappy Ricks isn't the only damned fool left in the
      shipping business. My boy, you'd be surprised at the number of so-called
      business men who are entirely devoid of imagination. Dozens of them still
      think the war will end this fall, but I'm willing to make a healthy bet
      that the fall of 1917 still finds them going to it to beat four of a
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something that time, father-in-law,&rdquo; Matt replied laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he roughed the old man affectionately and went forth into California
      Street, where he wore out much shoe leather before he located what he
      considered a bargain and reported back to the president emeritus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Cappy!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You aren't the only boob in the
      shipping business. I've located another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you get by taking father's advice,&rdquo; Gappy retorted proudly.
      &ldquo;Have you bought a steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I'm going to buy one this afternoon. She's going to cost us half
      a million dollars, cash on the nail, and I have an option on her at that
      figure until noon today. Skinner has a lot of lumber money he isn't using,
      and I'm going to borrow a quarter of a million from his company on the
      Blue Star note at six per cent. Don't want to run our own treasury too
      low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog-gone that Skinner! That's some more of his efficiency. I own both
      companies, and it's just like taking money out of one pocket and putting
      it into the other; but Skinner's a bug on system. Just think of making me
      pay myself six per cent interest! However, I suppose we must have some
      kind of order. What's the name of the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Penelope</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks slid out to the edge of his chair, placed one hand on each
      knee, and appraisingly eyed his son-in-law over the rims of his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again, Matt&mdash;and say it slow,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said <i>Penelope&mdash;P-e-n-e-l-o-p-e</i>. Maybe you call her the <i>Pen-elope!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you buying her as is?&rdquo; Matt nodded. &ldquo;To hear you tell it, Matt, one
      might gather the impression that half a million dollars is about what we
      give the janitor at Christmas. Boy, half a million dollars is real money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the shipping business these days, Cappy. Why, you have to wave
      that much under an owner's nose before he'll look up and show interest
      enough to ask you who you are and who let you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the man who would, in cold blood, consider paying half a million
      dollars for the <i>Penelope</i> is certainly ripe for a padded cell,&rdquo;
       Cappy jeered. &ldquo;That fellow Hudner, of the Black Butte Lumber Company, owns
      her, does he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know exactly the condition she's in. I'll bet a cooky her bottom
      plates are rusted so thin from lack of an occasional coat of red paint
      that if you were to stand on her bridge and toss a tack hammer down her
      main hatch you'd punch a hole in her. She's a long, narrow-gutted, cranky
      coffin&mdash;that's what she is; and the worst-found ship in Pacific
      waters. Why, let me tell you something, young man: she can't get by the
      inspectors this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has just gotten by them,&rdquo; Matt contradicted. &ldquo;Passed yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that signify? When her skipper has her up for inspection he
      scours the water front like a hungry dog, borrowing a boathook here, a
      sound life-boat there, some fire buckets elsewhere, a hose from the fire
      tug, and a lot of engine-room tools wherever he can get them. As for life
      preservers, he rents them for ten cents each from a marine junk dealer.
      So, when the inspectors arrive, the <i>Penelope</i> is a well-found ship;
      as soon as they pass her the skipper returns the equipment, with thanks.
      As for paint&mdash;why, the only painting she ever gets is when Hudner
      lays her alongside some British ship to discharge a foreign cargo of
      lumber into the lime-juicer; then her mate steals all the paint in the
      Britisher's lazaret. The poor, unfortunate devil! He has to do something
      to make a showing with the <i>Penelope's</i> owner! I tell you, Matt, I
      know this man Hudner! He's as thrifty as an Armenian and as slippery as a
      skating rink. He's laying to stab you, boy. Mind your step!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, Cappy, she's a bargain. I expect to spend fifty thousand dollars
      putting her in first-class condition after we get her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expect to spend it! Why, how you talk! Hudner is the one that should
      spend that money. For the love of trade, what is he selling you? A ship or
      a hulk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what she is; we can make her pay for herself and earn half a
      million or a million extra before this war ends. And she won't be such a
      bad vessel after she's shipped a couple of new plates. She has a dead
      weight capacity for six thousand tons and was built at Sunderland in 1902.
      When she went ashore off Point Sur, in 1909, Hudner bought her from the
      underwriters for five thousand dollars and spent more than half her
      original cost repairing her. That, of course, made her tantamount to a
      ship built in the United States, and under American registry she can run
      between American ports. And that's what we want. She'll be just the thing
      to carry lumber to New York, via the Canal, when the war ends and the
      nitrate harvest is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks threw up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see before you, my boy,&rdquo; he said mournfully, &ldquo;a dollar-burdened,
      world-weary old man, who for ten years has been trying to retire from
      active business, and cannot. The reason is he dassent; if he dassed, this
      shebang would be in the hands of the sheriff within a year. Now, listen,
      young feller! I know all about the <i>Penelope</i>. Before the war she had
      repaid Hudner, with interest, every cent she cost him, and since the war I
      suppose she's made half a million dollars. Now when Hudner finds he has to
      spend a lot of money fixing her up, he figures it's best to get rid of her
      and saddle somebody else with the bill. Her intrinsic value is just about
      one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, and when Hudner asks half a
      million for her he expects to get four hundred and fifty thousand. In
      order to play safe, go back and offer him four hundred thousand dollars;
      presently he'll come down fifty thousand and you'll come up fifty
      thousand, and the trade will be closed on that basis. Meantime I'll sit
      here and weep as I reflect on the cost of putting that ruin in fit shape
      to receive a Blue Star house flag. I tell you, Matt, I wouldn't send
      Pancho Villa to sea in her as she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley, like Cappy Ricks, was a Yankee; when he did business he
      liked to chaffer; and, after all&mdash;he thought&mdash;there was a
      certain shrewd philosophy in what his foxy father-in-law had said. At
      least Cappy had supplied him with ammunition for argument; so he went back
      to Hudner's office and argued and pleaded and ridiculed, but all to no
      avail. He returned to Cappy Ricks' office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fought him all over his office,&rdquo; he complained, &ldquo;but he wouldn't come
      down a cent. I think we'd better take a chance and give him half a
      million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! Stay with him, Matt. I know Hudner. He acts like he's full
      of bellicose veins, but anybody can outgame him. Let your option expire;
      then to-morrow meet him accidentally on 'Change and talk with him half an
      hour about everything on earth except the S. S. <i>Penelope</i>. Just
      before you leave him he'll grab you by the lapel of your coat and ask if
      you're still interested in the <i>Penelope</i>. Then you say: 'Why, yes&mdash;moderately;
      but not at half a million.' Then you make him a firm offer&mdash;for the
      last time&mdash;of four hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and he'll say:
      'I'll split the difference with you'&mdash;and before he can crawfish you
      accept. You're bound to make at least twenty-five thousand by following my
      advice, Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley ran his big hand through his thick black locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jingo,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;we'd make twenty-five thousand dollars while
      we're dickering with Hudner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, my boy; but then I don't like Hudner, and it's awful to do
      business with a son of a horsethief you don't like and let him put one
      over on you. That's the thrill of doing business, Matt. Though I'd hate to
      have anybody think I'm in business for fun, still, if I thought I couldn't
      get some fun out of business I'd go right down to Mission Street Wharf and
      end all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nitrate freights are up to thirty dollars a ton,&rdquo; said Matt later that
      day. &ldquo;They were twelve a year and a half ago. Cappy, we can't risk the
      delay; and I'm sorry I took your advice and let my option expire. I insist
      on buying.&rdquo; He reached for Cappy's desk 'phone. &ldquo;I'm going to tell Hudner
      to prepare the bill of sale&mdash;that I'll be up in fifteen minutes with
      the check. He who hesitates is lost, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and a youth stood in the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. J. O. Heyfuss is calling,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in immediately,&rdquo; Cappy ordered, glad of the opportunity to delay
      Matt's telephonic acceptance of the vessel at Hudner's price. &ldquo;Hold on a
      minute, Matt,&rdquo; he continued, turning to his son-in-law. &ldquo;Heyfuss is a ship
      broker; maybe he has a ship to sell us; she might prove to be a better buy
      than the <i>Penelope</i>... Howdy, Heyfuss? Come in and sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heyfuss entered smilingly, saluted both satellites of the Blue Star
      and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;wonders will never cease. Every day I'm
      seeing, hearing and doing wonderful things in the shipping business. Day
      before yesterday I bought the old barkentine <i>Mayfair</i>. She'd been
      laid up in Rotten Row for seven years, and for at least four years the
      tide has been rising and falling inside her. She cost me seven hundred and
      fifty dollars, and I sold her the same afternoon to Al Hanify for a
      thousand. Not very much of a profit; but then it was Saturday and
      everybody closes up shop at noon, you know. So I felt the day wasn't a
      blank, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you suppose Al did? You'll laugh. He called up Crowley her
      out on Hanlon's Marine Way, putting a new bottom in her. They're going to
      spend twenty thousand dollars on her; and when she's ready for sea Redell
      has a cargo of fir for Sydney waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll come back with coal and make her owners at least fifty thousand
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very interesting to outsiders, but commonplace stuff to us,&rdquo;
       Cappy reminded his visitor. &ldquo;Have you got a commission to sell a ship for
      somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surest thing you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll sell you the <i>Alden Besse</i>. She's an old tea
      clipper, built in the forties; but she's sound and tight. Been a motion
      picture ship for the past five years. I can deliver her to you for forty
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you'll not. I sold her to the motion picture people for fifteen
      hundred,&rdquo; Cappy countered, &ldquo;and I don't want her back at any price. I send
      my boys to sea to earn a safe living, not to visit Davy Jones' locker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think I might get you the old Australian prison ship, <i>Success</i>.
      She was built at Rangoon in 1790, of teak, and will last forever. Perhaps
      you saw her when she was exhibited at the Exposition last year. Might get
      her for you kind of cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing. Heyfuss, we want a steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, but I haven't a thing in steamers. Just sold the last one I had
      ten minutes ago&mdash;the <i>Penelope</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what!&rdquo; Matt Peasley and Cappy cried in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Penelope</i>. Sold her to a big Eastern powder company. She goes
      into the nitrate trade, of course. These munition manufacturers must have
      powder, and to get powder they must have nitrate, and to get nitrate they
      must have ships, and to get ships they must pay the price. I got Hudner a
      million dollars for that ruin of a <i>Penelope.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley gently seized J. O. Heyfuss by the ear and led him to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out, thief!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You can't sell us anything; so we don't want you
      hanging round this office. You might steal the safe or a roll-top desk, or
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heyfuss departed, laughing good-naturedly, and Matt Peasley turned to
      confront Cappy Ricks. The latter had shrunk up in his chair and was
      looking as chopfallen and guilty as a dog caught sucking eggs. He favored
      his big son-in-law with a quick, shifty glance, and then looked down at
      the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt folded his arms and stared at him until he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you go to pick on me!&rdquo; he warned Matt furiously. &ldquo;I'll not be
      picked on in my own office, even by a relative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt threw back his head and chanted,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>&ldquo;There was I, waiting at the church,
    Waiting at the church&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;My mode of procedure was without a flaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely! The operation was a success, but the patient died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a feller just has to haggle!&rdquo; Cappy wailed. He was almost on the
      verge of tears. &ldquo;It's the basic principle of all trading. Why, I've made
      my everlasting fortune by haggling. Drat your picture, don't you know that
      the very pillars of financial success rest on counter-propositions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, relative, listen: I haven't said a word to you, have I?&rdquo; Matt
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you looked it, and I'll not be looked at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Cappy, I'll not look. But I can't help thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it's about time you quit talking about retiring&mdash;and retired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER XLVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      With this Parthian shot Matt himself retired, leaving Cappy to shiver and
      bow his head on his breast; in which position he remained motionless for
      fully an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the boy's right,&rdquo; he soliloquized finally. &ldquo;I think I'd better
      retire, after pulling that kind of a deal twice in the same place. The
      pace is getting too swift for me, I think; I can't keep up... Well, I
      guess they've got the goods on me this time. Matt was certainly on the job
      twice, and I blocked him both times ... Oh, Lord! I'll never hear the last
      of this... By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, I've lost my punch! Matt didn't
      say so; but he thinks it. And I don't blame him a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of Cappy's office opened and again the youth stood in the
      entrance. &ldquo;Mr. Redell is calling; there's a gentleman with him,&rdquo; he
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell 'em I'm busier'n a cranberry merchant,&rdquo; Cappy snarled. &ldquo;And unless
      you're figuring on hunting a new job, my son, don't you come in here again
      today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth retired. However, he knew from experience that Cappy Ricks never
      discharged anybody save for insubordination or rank incompetence; hence,
      he did not hesitate to disobey the old gentleman's edict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Redell says his business is very important,&rdquo; he announced, presenting
      himself once more at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! No rest for the weary. Show them in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell entered, accompanied by no less a personage than the
      British Consul. Cappy greeted them without enthusiasm and bade them be
      seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; J. Augustus Redell announced cheerily, &ldquo;It's plain to be seen that
      Little Sunshine hasn't been round this office recently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's gone wrong, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything! Been going wrong for years and I never realized it until this
      afternoon. Ah, Gus, my dear young friend, how I envy you your youth, your
      capacity to think, your golden dreams, your boundless energy, your ability
      to make two-dollar bills grow where one-dollar bills grew before, thus
      making an apparently barren prospect as verdant as a meadow in spring. But
      make the most of your opportunity, young feller! The day will come to you,
      as it has come to me, when everything you do will be done twenty minutes
      too late; when every dollar you make will be subject to a cash discount of
      one hundred per cent; when every competitor you held cheap will suddenly
      develop the luck of the devil, the brains of a Demosthenes, and the
      courage of a hog going to war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should judge that you have recently suffered a great bereavement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, Augustus, I have. Through my indecision I have just lost a bank
      roll a greyhound couldn't have jumped over. Suppose it was a paper profit?
      I grieve just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget it, Cappy! Life is real, life is earnest, and you have a bank roll
      of real profits a giraffe couldn't reach the top of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't the money, Gus. Money is only a vulgar symbol of my
      bereavement. The trouble is&mdash;I've lost my punch! I can't think, Gus;
      I can't act promptly. I'm out of touch with my times. I remind myself of
      nothing so much as the old rooster that suddenly discovered he had been
      elected to furnish the dinner the following Sunday. His hens cackled and
      called to him that they had found some worms, but he wouldn't pay any
      attention to them; just leaned up against the wire netting in the poultry
      yard and said to himself: 'Oh, hell! What's the use? Today an egg&mdash;tomorrow
      a feather duster!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be pessimistic, Cappy. Don't! It doesn't become you, and I don't
      believe a word you're telling me. You're still the old he-fox of the
      world; and I've come to you for help on a deal that's going to mean a
      whole lot of money to both of us if we can only put it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Gus, but I'm not interested. As a matter of fact, I've
      retired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Nonsense! I know where there's a beautiful ten-thousand-ton,
      net register, steel steamer to be bought for three hundred thousand
      dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks threw out an arm and pressed his hand against Redell's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Sh-h-h! Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the agility of a man half his age Cappy ran to the door, bolted it on
      the inside and returned to his desk. He was rubbing his hands and his eyes
      were aglow with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you sh-h-h-ing about?&rdquo; Redell demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt Peasley and that cowardly Skinner. Not a word of this to them, Gus!
      Not&mdash;a&mdash;whisper!&rdquo; And he winked one eye and twisted up the
      corner of his mouth knowingly. Mr. Redell nodded his promise and Cappy
      went on: &ldquo;Now Gus, my dear young friend, start in at the beginning and
      tell me everything. I assume, of course, that this is real business and
      not another of your jokes on the old man. Word of honor, Gus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word of honor, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; blaze away! Come, come! What have you got to offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a condition and I offer you a half interest in it if you can
      suggest a plan to circumvent His Royal Highness, Kaiser Wilhelm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum-m-m! Enough!&rdquo; Cappy interrupted, and turned to the British Consul:
      &ldquo;This is an international affair, eh? See if I don't state the proposition
      in a nutshell&mdash;if I may be pardoned the bromide. This steamer is a
      German, and the proposition is to get her under the American flag so
      firmly that she'll stay there; then, I suppose, we're to charter her to
      the British Government, or one of Britain's allies&mdash;Russia, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell and the British Consul exchanged admiring winks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you, Mister Consul?&rdquo; Redell declared triumphantly. &ldquo;Mr.
      Ricks knows the story before we have told it. And yet he's complaining
      about the loss of his punch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy looked slightly self-conscious; it was plain the compliment pleased
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gus, my boy,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have lost my punch, though at that
      I'm not exactly a pork-and-beaner. Hum-m-m! Ahem! Harumph-h-h! This must
      be a hard order to fill. Mister Consul, when Gus Redell has to come to me
      for help. That son of a gun can move faster and go through more obstacles
      than quicksilver. Gus, what's gone wrong with you? Have you lost your
      punch too? And at your age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like it, Cappy. I've thought and thought until I'm desperate, and
      not an idea worth while has presented itself. That's why I've come to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't guarantee a cure, my boy. But I'll say this much: If you
      and I can't put this thing over, then it just isn't put-overable. Fire
      away, Gus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard of the steamer <i>Bavarian?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! She belongs to Adolph Koenitz and flies the German flag. Since
      the war started she's been interned down in Mission Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redell nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolph Koenitz never became an American citizen, despite the fact that he
      had lived in San Francisco twenty years and operated three steamers out of
      this port. He was a reserve officer in the German Navy; and when the war
      broke out he interned his ships, placed his entire estate in his wife's
      name and reported for duty. He perished in the Battle of Jutland, both his
      boys were killed at Verdun, and now his widow would like to sell the <i>Bavarian</i>
      and get some cash. She had a large income from an estate in Germany, but
      the war cut that off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, it appears that Koenitz was rather heavily involved, and the
      expense of maintaining those interned steamers, with their German crews
      aboard, has his widow badly worried; in fact, she has reached the point
      where she finds it necessary to sell one of the steamers in order to hang
      on to the other two. She has tried to raise a mortgage on the <i>Bavarian</i>,
      but nobody cares to loan money on an interned German steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Cappy replied sarcastically. &ldquo;And I'm amazed that you should
      consider me boob enough to consider seriously buying the same steamer
      outright! Gus, I'd have about as much use for that steamer as I would have
      for a tail. Even if I should buy her now, and not use her until the war is
      over, I should be risking my money; for the German Government, if you
      remember, issued an order in 1915 forbidding its subjects to sell their
      interned ships without the consent of the said government. And, even if
      Mrs. Koenitz can procure the Kaiser's consent, I fail to see the wisdom of
      tying up three hundred thousand dollars in an idle investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but under those circumstances she wouldn't be an idle investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she would, my boy. Great Britain issued an Order in Council in 1914
      notifying all neutral nations that she would not sanction the transfer of
      registry of any German vessel. A few daring devils took a chance&mdash;and
      what happened? The British Navy overhauled the ships at sea and took them
      into a British port where a British prize court confiscated them. There is
      the case of the <i>Mazatlan</i>, for instance. She was German owned and
      flew the German flag; her owner put her under the Mexican flag, and
      subsequently she was sold at a bargain to one of our neighbors, who put
      her under American registry. Do you know where the <i>Mazatlan</i> is now?
      Well, I'll tell you: She's freighting war munitions for Johnny Bull&mdash;and
      our optimistic neighbor isn't collecting the freight money either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, Mr. Ricks; quite true&mdash;in ordinary cases,&rdquo; the Consul
      told him smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet! I smell a mouse. Hum-m-m! That simplifies
      matters. We-l-l! If you are in position, Mister Consul, to give me your
      word of honor as a gentleman and an officer of your king that the British
      Navy will turn its blind side to the <i>Bavarian</i> when she puts to sea,
      I'll buy the <i>Bavarian</i> so fast it'll make your head swim. In return
      for this favor, of course, I am to charter the ship at the going rates to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our ally, the Russian Government, Mr. Ricks. And you have my word of
      honor, which is all I can give you; for a deal like this, as you know,
      cannot be made in writing. I have had the matter up with the Admiralty,
      however, and permission has been granted me to give the verbal assurance
      of my government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make a finger bet with your government, Mister Consul. As for Kaiser
      Bill's consent to the transfer&mdash;<i>heraus mit 'em!</i> We'll get
      along without that. Wilhelm doesn't cut much ice with me these days and
      I'm willing to wager the price of the <i>Bavarian</i> that such ice as he
      does cut will blame soon melt. Gus, you say Mrs. Koenitz wants to sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she doesn't care who buys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a particle! She's sore on the Kaiser; it's been thumbs down on
      Wilhelm ever since Adolph and the boys lost the number of their mess. She
      says to me: 'Herr Riddle, dot Kaiser orders war like I order beer!'
      However, there's an 'if' to the transfer. While we know the British Navy
      will not bother us should we buy the steamer, still enthusiastic
      Britishers all over the world will have their eyes on the <i>Bavarian</i>
      and clamor for her capture. Great Britain cannot publicly&mdash;or, at
      least, obviously&mdash;make any exceptions to her Order in Council, and
      we'll have to mess up that steamer's title and nativity to save John
      Bull's social standing. We must make a bluff at deceiving him. If we can
      show some sort of legal transfer to another flag J. B. can play blindman's
      buff with dignity and honor; otherwise nix!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks' eyes sought the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done to deserve this?&rdquo; he demanded of an invisible Presence.
      &ldquo;Why am I afflicted thus? Job had his boils; but you and I, Augustus, are
      covered with a financial rash, bleeding at every pore, and with no relief
      in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you this was a tough one, Cappy. I've pondered the situation until
      my brain is addled like a last year's nest egg, and finally I've come to
      you as a last resort. If you can't cook up an airtight scheme, then there
      is no help; and I'm going to forget the <i>Bavarian</i> and attend to some
      business more profitable and less debilitating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be an out, Gus. It's too good a thing to abandon. Suppose you
      and the Consul go away and give me time to concentrate my thoughts on this
      problem. It's a holy terror; but&mdash;Well, I've seen dogs almost as sick
      as this one cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; Mr. Redell murmured fervently. &ldquo;Consul, let us depart and
      leave Mr. Ricks to himself. Call me up, Cappy, when you see a ray of
      light. Two heads are better than one, you know.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When his visitors had gone Cappy Ricks gave orders that he was not to be
      disturbed on any pretext whatever. Then he locked himself in, swung his
      legs to the top of his desk, slid low in his chair until he rested on his
      spine, bowed his head on his breast and closed his eyes. The battle was
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour later J. Augustus Redell entered breathlessly in response to a
      telephonic invitation from Cappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gus,&rdquo; the latter began, &ldquo;am I right in assuming that you possess a
      reasonable amount of influence with that hair-trigger partner of yours,
      Live Wire Luiz?&rdquo; Redell nodded. &ldquo;And is Luiz absolutely trustworthy? Will
      he stay put and keep his mouth closed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my partner, Cappy. He's mercurial, but a gentleman. I'd trust him
      with my life, and I always trust him with my bank roll. He requires no
      watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Gus, send Live Wire Luiz down to Guaymas and have him incorporate
      the North and South American Steamship Company there, under the extremely
      flexible and evershifting laws of the Republic of Mexico. Luiz is a
      Peruvian and speaks Spanish, and knows the Mexican temperament. He can
      easily procure three Mexicans to act as a dummy board of directors; his
      own name, of course, for obvious reasons, must never appear in connection
      with this company. A thousand dollars ought to cover this Mexican
      expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider that point attended to, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! Now then, when this corporate vehicle is in running order and has
      opened an office in Guaymas, Live Wire Luiz will write your company, The
      West Coast Trading Company, saying that his company has been referred to
      you by some mutual friends in Guaymas. Of course Luiz doesn't sign this
      letter. It is signed by the North and South American Steamship Company,
      per the dummy secretary or president. The letter goes on to say that the
      latter company is in the market for a steamer, the general specifications
      of which, singularly enough, fit the <i>Bavarian.</i> The vessel is to be
      used for transporting troops up and down the west coast of Mexico and for
      freighting munitions from Japan; and in a delicate way it might be hinted
      that the de facto Mexican Government is the real buyer. A commission of
      five per cent is offered you for buying the vessel for them, said
      commission to be split fifty-fifty with the North and South American
      Steamship Company; this being the Mexican way of doing business, as you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider that matter attended to also. I'll write the letter myself
      before Luiz starts for Guaymas, so I'll be certain the job will be done
      exactly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you receive this letter you get busy and wire the North and
      South American Steamship Company that you have just the vessel they want,
      price three hundred thousand dollars. Live Wire Luiz will then cause a
      reply to that telegram to be sent, advising you that his clients would not
      balk at paying half a million! That, of course, is hint enough for you.
      Right away you see the old Mexican graft sticking out, and you say to
      yourself, 'Why not?' And you do! You reply to that telegram, saying you
      erred when naming the price in your first telegram; that it is five
      hundred thousand instead of three. Then you come down to me and I hand you
      three hundred thousand dollars in currency; for in such a transaction as
      this, checks, with their indorsements, provide a trail that may prove
      embarrassing. You take that money and deposit it in escrow in any local
      bank against a bill of sale of the <i>Bavarian</i> from Mrs. Koenitz to
      the North and South American Steamship Company, of Guaymas, Mexico. Before
      doing so, however, have Mrs. Koenitz place the vessel under Mexican
      registry. She can do that through the Mexican Consul for the de facto
      government; and when the bill of sale is turned over to you, record it
      promptly with the Mexican Consul. Later you will record it in Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vessel is now the property of the North and South American Steamship
      Company; and the North and South American Steamship Company is the
      property of Cappy Ricks and the West Coast Trading Company, per Senor
      Felipe Luiz Almeida. But we must never admit this. To have the North and
      South American Steamship Company transfer the vessel to us would be very
      coarse work indeed; so we must avoid that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get to that presently. The steamer is now in our possession, and you
      will already have notified her German skipper and crew to hunt a new
      residence. You will then put an American skipper in charge and ship
      American engineers and a crew of parrakeets; and on the very day the sale
      is consummated, just before the customhouse closes, have the skipper clear
      the vessel for Guaymas and put to sea that night. Since she carries no
      cargo the collector of the port will not stop you; the risk of going to
      sea is all our own&mdash;if we care to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day the newspaper boys will be hot on the trail. An interned
      German merchantman has suddenly transferred to Mexican registry and put to
      sea! Now! Inquiry at the customhouse and at the Mexican consulate shows
      that the vessel has been sold, and the trail leads straight to the office
      of the West Coast Trading Company. You are interviewed&mdash;and say
      nothing; and that day, when I appear on 'Change, these baffled journalists
      drive me into a corner and ask me what I think about it. And I'll tell
      them it's just another case of the lowly Mexican peon being hornswoggled
      by the foxy Americano. The Mexicans wanted a ship and asked the American
      to buy one for them. He did&mdash;only he forgot to tell them she was a
      German. She was such a good buy they snapped her up without asking
      questions, though in all probability the poor devils had no knowledge of
      Kaiser Wilhelm's edict that no German ships shall be sold without the
      consent of the German Government. I will say that it looks to me as if the
      ancient rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> applied, and that the Mexicans are
      stung and have no comeback. Then, again, it may be a shrewd German trick
      to put something over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they make a snorting story out of what I give them; the frau's
      friends read it and think she's done something smart. Nobody feels sorry
      for a Mexican. Next morning you come out with a blast of righteous
      indignation and admit that you cannot or will not deny that the vessel was
      sold to parties representing the de facto Mexican Government. You deny,
      however, that you sold them a pig in a poke; and the papers print a copy
      of your letter to the North and South American Steamship Company
      specifically advising them that the vessel was a German and liable to
      prove an embarrassment. This, of course, clears you, and the blame for the
      graft is placed where it belongs&mdash;on the shoulders of the North and
      South American Steamship Company, which has deliberately stung the de
      facto government!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy,&rdquo; said J. Augustus Redell admiringly, &ldquo;you're immense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the nomination. Upon her arrival in Guaymas the <i>Bavarian's</i>
      name is changed to <i>La Golondrina</i>, or <i>Sobre las Olas</i>, or <i>Manana</i>,
      or <i>Poco Tiempo</i>&mdash;whatever's right. I think we may safely gamble
      that she will arrive in Guaymas in the light of what the British Consul
      told us; and, in view of her departure unannounced, no British warship on
      the West Coast can get so far north as Guaymas in time to intercept her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, having changed her name, she picks up a general cargo and comes
      back to San Francisco, where she goes on dry dock and is cleaned and
      painted, has her gear overhauled, fills up with fuel oil and stores, and&mdash;but
      that's enough. Now comes the blow-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange to relate, you haven't received a cent of that five-per-cent
      commission due you from the North and South American Steamship Company for
      buying the <i>Bavarian</i> for them. The issue is in dispute. They claim
      you are not entitled to any commission, because you stung them with a
      German vessel; and you claim you told them she was a German, but that they
      needed her so badly they would take a chance. Also, the fact that she went
      to sea that time in such a hurry, and forgot to pay for her fuel oil and
      stores, looks rather suspicious; so, when the vessel comes off dry dock,
      with about ten thousand dollars' worth of bills against her, you decide to
      protect your claim for the commission&mdash;and, by the Holy Pink-Toed
      Prophet, Gus, you libel her! The news breaks into the papers, and next day
      every creditor of the ship files a libel on her, also, to protect his
      claim. Gus, she'll have so many plasters on her she'll look like a German
      coming home from the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell leaped from his chair and picked little Cappy Ricks up
      in his arms and hugged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cappy! Cappy!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;You're the shadow of a rock in a weary
      land&mdash;a cup of cool water in the suburbs of hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you game?&rdquo; Cappy gurgled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a cat eat liver? Cappy, you've solved the problem! Naturally the
      North and South American Steamship Company does not directly or indirectly
      make any attempt to lift these libels and get the vessel to sea. Why? I'll
      tell you&mdash;or, rather, I'll tell the newspaper boys and they'll tell
      everybody. It will appear that as soon as the Mexican Consul here got an
      inkling of the apparent plan of the North and South American Steamship
      Company, of Guaymas, to sting Don Venustiano Carranza by slipping him a
      steamer with a clouded title, he must have wired Don Venustiano to round
      up the directors of the said company and give them the <i>ley fuga</i>.
      Fortunately for these culprits, however, they got next in time to get out
      from under. Mounting swift steeds, the entire board of directors fled
      north and east, never pausing until they had joined Pancho Villa; and we
      learn from some Border gossips that all three subsequently were killed in
      action. But, before leaving Guaymas, they left their tangled steamship
      affairs in the hands of their attorney&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing, Gus! They left their tangled steamship affairs in the
      hands of my attorney, and they gave him an absolute, ironclad, airtight
      power of attorney to sell the ship, receive and receipt for all money due
      the company, and so on, and so on, ad libitum, ad infinitum; said power of
      attorney being nonrevocable for five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great stuff! In due course the libelants sue in the United States
      District Court; your attorney appears for the defendants and confesses
      judgment, but pleads for a ten-day stay of execution until he can raise a
      mortgage on the vessel. But, strange to relate, the ten-day stay expires
      and the judgments against the steamer are not paid; so the judge of the
      United States District Court orders the steamer sold at public auction on
      the floor of the Merchants' Exchange to the highest bidder, to satisfy the
      claims of the creditors. Thirty days later the United States Marshal
      conducts the sale, and a gentleman named Cappy Ricks buys her in. The
      United States Marshal gives the said Ricks a bill of sale for her, which
      the said Ricks thereupon records in the United States Customhouse, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Und Hoch der Kaiser! Und Hoch der</i> John J. Bull! We've finally got
      that clear American title we've been looking for. It makes no difference
      what the nationality of a vessel is; the minute she enters the territorial
      waters of the United States of America she is amenable to the laws of the
      United States of America, one of which reads thusly: 'Thou shalt pay thy
      bills; and if thou dost not, then <i>poco tiempo</i> thou shalt be made to
      pay them, even unto the seizure and sale of thy ship.' And with the
      purchase of that ship, under an order of sale issued by the United States
      District Court, she becomes a United States ship; we register her as such;
      and the United States simply has to stand back of the bill of sale it gave
      us. Germany knows that; England knows it; Austria knows it; and from the
      jackstaff of the late <i>Bavarian</i>, now renamed the <i>Alden M. Peasley</i>,
      in honor of my first grandson, there floats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. Augustus Redell raised his index finger, enjoining silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then! One, two, three! Down, left, up!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>&ldquo;O-ho, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
         What so-ho pro-houdly we hailed at the twilight's last
            gleaming?&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks sprang to attention. Presently, through the partition, his
      cracked old voice reached Mr. Skinner:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>&ldquo;Then conquer we must, when our cause is so just;
         And this be our motto: 'May we nev-er go bust!'&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's doing here?&rdquo; Mr. Skinner demanded, banging at the door, which was
      locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go way back and sit down!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;I'll show you and Matt
      Peasley where to head in, yet&mdash;see if I don't!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks and J. Augustus Redell arrived at the Merchants' Exchange
      promptly at one o'clock on the date of the sale of the S. S. <i>General
      Carranza,</i> as the <i>Bavarian</i> was now called. Just inside the door
      they paused and looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whe-e-e-ew!&rdquo; murmured Cappy Ricks. &ldquo;All the shipping men in the world are
      here to bid on our property, Gus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redell whistled softly. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be some auction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing that a shipping man in this country has more
      respect for than an Order in Council&mdash;and that is an Order in the
      United States District Court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. It's backed up by our army and navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, somebody's sporting blood is going to be
      tested today; and something tells, me, Augustus, my dear young friend,
      that it's going to be Matt Peasley's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so, Cappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Cappy chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having used German methods to bring about this auction sale,&rdquo; he
      confessed, &ldquo;I concluded to steal a little more of this Teutonic stuff; so
      I established a system of espionage in Skinner's office and another in
      Matt Peasley's. Gus, I got a lot of low-down information on those two
      young pups; they're trying to slip something over on the old dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they'll never teach him any new tricks, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it! I observe that, as usual, Jim Searles will conduct the
      auction. He's climbing up on the block now, and, by the Toenails of Moses,
      Matt Peasley is on the job! Look, Gus! You can see his black head sticking
      up out of the heart of the riot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cappy and Redell joined the crowd Jim Searles, by acclamation the
      auctioneer of the Port of San Francisco, rapped smartly with his little
      gavel, and a tense silence settled over the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Mr. Searles announced, &ldquo;will be a fight to a finish, winner take
      all. In accordance with an order of the United States District Court I am
      about to sell, at public auction, to the highest bidder, the Mexican
      Steamship <i>General Carranza</i>, ex-German Steamship <i>Bavarian</i>, to
      satisfy the following judgments: Mr. J. Augustus Redell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; roared Matt Peasley. &ldquo;We've all read the list of creditors,
      and you're only gumming up the game. Come down to business Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy, Peasley! Sure! Cut it out, Jim! Get busy!&rdquo; A dozen voices
      seconded Captain Matt Peasley's motion and Jim Searles rapped for order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much am I offered?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One million dollars!&rdquo; roared Matt Peasley.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fringe of the eager crowd Cappy Ricks leaned up against his friend
      Redell and commenced to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young scoundrel!&rdquo; he chortled. &ldquo;He never said a word to me about this
      auction; he was afraid I'd butt in and block his purchase; so, for his
      impudence, I'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget. Bid, Gus! Bet 'em
      as high as a hound's back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Matt Peasley, representing the Blue Star Navigation Company, bids
      one million dollars. Chicken feed! Won't some real sport please tilt the
      ante?&rdquo; Jim Searles pleaded. &ldquo;Don't waste my time, gentlemen. It's
      valuable. Let's get this thing over and go back to our offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One million five hundred thousand!&rdquo; called J. Augustus Redell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called for a sport and drew a piker,&rdquo; Jim Searles retorted. &ldquo;Mr. J.
      Augustus Redell, of the West Coast Trading Company, bids a million and a
      half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Dalton Mann, representing the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, raised
      his hand and snapped his fingers at the auctioneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a hundred thousand!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a hundred thousand!&rdquo; Matt Peasley retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fifty thousand!&rdquo; Mann flung back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley eyed his antagonist belligerently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's doing very well for a young fellow,&rdquo; Searles complimented the last
      bidder. &ldquo;Skipper Peasley, are you going to let this landlubber outgame
      you? He has bid a million and three-quarters. Think of the present high
      freight rates and speak up, or remain forever silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bidding had so suddenly and by such prodigious bounds reached the
      elimination point that every piker present was afraid to open his mouth in
      the presence of these plungers. Matt Peasley licked his lips and glanced
      round rather helplessly. He knew he had about reached the limit of his
      bidding, but he suspected that Mann had reached his also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ten thousand!&rdquo; he shouted desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheap stuff! Cheap stuff!&rdquo; the crowd jeered good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks nudged J. Augustus Redell as Mann waved his hand in token of
      surrender. &ldquo;One million seven hundred and sixty thousand I am offered,&rdquo;
       the auctioneer intoned. &ldquo;Any further bids?&rdquo; He waited a full minute; then
      resorted to three minutes of cajolery, but in vain. There were no more
      bids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Searles raised his hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going&mdash;once!&rdquo; he called&mdash;and waited. &ldquo;Going&mdash;twice!&rdquo;
       Another pause. &ldquo;Going&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two million dollars!&rdquo; cried J. Augustus Redell; and a sigh went up from
      the excited onlookers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Redell is a sport, after all! Two million, flat!&rdquo; Searles looked
      down on Matt Peasley. &ldquo;Die, dog, or eat the meat ax!&rdquo; he warned the
      unhappy young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him have her,&rdquo; Matt growled; and, very red of face, he commenced to
      shoulder his way through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beat it, Cappy; he's coming!&rdquo; Redell warned the president emeritus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks, dodging round the flank of the crowd, fled through the side
      entrance of the Merchants' Exchange; and he was tranquilly smoking a cigar
      in his private office when Matt Peasley dropped in on him an hour later.
      Cappy eyed him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Skinner back from luncheon?&rdquo; he demanded. Matt nodded. &ldquo;Tell him to
      come in here. I want to see him,&rdquo; Cappy continued ominously. &ldquo;And you
      might stick round yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;Two million dollars'&rdquo; cried J Augustus Redell.}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo; Cappy commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner looked a little startled and surprised, but promptly closed
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks edged forward until he was seated on the extreme edge of his
      chair. Then he rested a hand on each knee, bent his head, and glared at
      the unhappy Skinner over the rims of his glasses. After thirty seconds of
      this scrutiny he turned to his son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hear you've been attending an auction sale and making
      a star-spangled monkey of yourself bidding a million seven hundred and
      sixty thousand dollars on that Mexican steamer. Matt, have you taken leave
      of your senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;not quite; but Gus Redell has. He bought her in for two
      million dollars. Of course he was acting for somebody else, because every
      cent he has is working overtime in the West Coast Trading Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Cappy murmured. &ldquo;Then you didn't get her, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! So perhaps you'd better not holler until you're hit.&rdquo; Matt
      sighed. &ldquo;By Neptune,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I'd give a cooky to know the name of
      the crazy man who paid two million dollars for that steamer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the lunatic, Matt! Grandpa Ricks, in his second childhood! Gus
      Redell was bidding for me, sonny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley sat down rather limply and stared at the president emeritus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;you sent a boy to do a man's work. I had the
      boat bought for a million seven hundred and sixty thousand! For heaven's
      sake, why didn't you tell me you wanted her? And I would have laid off.
      For the love of heaven, why did you go bidding against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me you wanted her, you big simp?&rdquo; Cappy retorted.
      &ldquo;You never said a word to me; and naturally Redell thought you were acting
      for somebody else. He had orders from me to get her and damn the cost&mdash;and
      he fulfilled his orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A comedy of errors, truly!&rdquo; Mr. Skinner observed witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley raised his huge arms and clenched his great fists in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cappy! Cappy!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Won't you please retire? You're just
      raising hell with the organization!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Matt; I'll retire. But, before I do, I'm going to give Skinner
      a piece of my mind. Skinner, what the devil do you mean by going up to the
      Marine National Bank and borrowing a million dollars on the credit of the
      Ricks Lumber Company? I admit I have given you entire charge of the lumber
      end, and you were quite within your rights when you negotiated the loan
      and signed the note as president; but how did it happen that you didn't
      consult with the old man, if only as a matter of common courtesy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I-that is, I-well, I didn't mean to be discourteous, Mr. Ricks. Oh, I
      wouldn't have you think, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you'd have me be a dummy if you could. Why, you almost put the skids
      under me; because, when I went up to the Marine National to make a little
      personal loan in a spirit of preparedness, I discovered that the loan you
      had been given on my assets had jazzed my personal credit all to glory! I
      used to be able to borrow a million dollars on my bare note; but I'll be
      shot if they didn't make me dig up a lot of collateral this time! Skinner,
      I wouldn't have thought that of you. After trusting you as I have done for
      a quarter of a century, to find you giving me the double-cross just about
      breaks my heart. Great Godfrey, Skinner, how could you be so false to me?
      I expect that sort of thing from Matt&mdash;those one loves the best
      always swat one; but from you&mdash;Skinner, I don't know what prevents me
      from demanding your resignation here and now, unless it be because of your
      previous splendid character and loyal service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ricks, Mr. Ricks!&rdquo; Poor Skinner held up his hands appealingly and
      commenced to weep. &ldquo;Please do not think ill of me. I swear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You loaned the Ricks Lumber Logging Company's million dollars to Matt
      Peasley to help buy that steamer for the Blue Star Navigation Company; and
      he, the son of a pirate, went to work and borrowed it from you, well
      knowing he had no business to do so. What are you paying the Marine
      National for that money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five per cent,&rdquo; Skinner sniffled, for his heart was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you soaking the Blue Star Navigation Company for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six,&rdquo; Skinner confessed miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Skinner, my boy. Cheer up! I forgive you. That little
      profit of one per cent saves your bacon, boy. I guess there's some good
      left in you still; and I'm happy to have this evidence that, though I own
      both companies, you have not forgotten you are responsible for the
      profit-and-loss account of one of them, and Matt Peasley for the other.
      You did quite right to claim that one per cent jerk from Matt. Business is
      business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you bet it is!&rdquo; Matt Peasley struck in. &ldquo;And I want you to lay off
      on Skinner, because what he did was done in fear and trembling, and under
      duress. We were both afraid you'd block the purchase; so we agreed to keep
      our plans secret from you, because&mdash;Well, somehow I did want that
      bully big boat the very worst way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's exactly the way you set about getting her, Matthew. However,
      you're young&mdash;you don't know any better; so I forgive you. Of course
      I realized you wanted, that steamer, boy. I knew your heart was set on
      seeing our house flag floating from her mainstruck; so I&mdash;Well, I
      just thought I'd get her for you, to sort of square myself for those two
      bonehead plays I pulled earlier in the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you shouldn't have paid two millions for her, Cappy! Business is
      one thing and sentiment is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I didn't pay any such price for her! Originally I bought her, as a
      German, for three hundred thousand dollars; in addition to that I've spent
      about ten thousand dollars improving her, and maybe five thousand more
      fussing up the trail of my operations so no smart secret-service operative
      could come round and hang something on me.&rdquo; He reached into his coat
      pocket and drew forth the United States Marshal's bill of sale. &ldquo;Here,
      sonny,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is your Uncle Sam's certificate of title. Hustle up
      to the customhouse and get it recorded; then make out a bill of sale for a
      one-third interest to the West Coast Trading Company and record that also.
      Then change her name to <i>Alden M. Peasley</i>, in honor of your
      first-born, and put her under these two flags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked open a drawer in the desk and brought forth a bright new edition
      of Old Glory, followed by the familiar white muslin burgee with the blue
      star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The United States Marshal has paid all the debts of the <i>Alden M.
      Peasley</i>, and this afternoon he'll send his check for the proceeds of
      the sale still remaining in his hands to my lawyer, who holds a most
      ungodly power of attorney from that dummy Guaymas corporation Live Wire
      Luiz organized to buy the ship for us. Our attorney will cash that check
      and send the cash down to you. Please bank it to my credit and take up
      that note I gave the Marine National; then get the securities I hocked and
      tuck them back in my safe-deposit vault. As for the interest at five per
      cent, which the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company will have to pay on
      that million you borrowed to help Matt Peasley hornswoggle father, you
      just charge that to your personal account as a penance for your sins. As
      for the six per cent you pay the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company for
      the money loaned your Blue Star Navigation Company, Matt Peasley, just
      charge that to your personal account as a penance for your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both culprits nodded dazedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Cappy continued, &ldquo;I'll tell you something else: The <i>Alden M.
      Peasley</i> belongs to the West Coast Trading Company and Alden P. Ricks;
      they own one-third for bringing the deal to my attention and furnishing
      some labor, and I own two-thirds, or the lion's share, for doing a lion's
      work&mdash;to wit, putting up the cash and promoting the deal to a clean
      title. Consequently, though you two boys own a nice little block of stock
      in the Blue Star Navigation Company, you don't own a red cent in the <i>Alden
      M. Peasley</i>, because she doesn't belong to the Blue Star Navigation
      Company, but to the president emeritus thereof. However, as I am about to
      retire for keeps this time, I'll tell you what I purpose doing with my
      two-thirds of the <i>Alden M. Peasley</i>: Skinner, my dear boy, I kidded
      you into tears. Bless you, boy, it broke your heart when you thought your
      old boss figured you'd quit being Faithful Fido, didn't it? Skinner,
      loyalty like yours is very, very precious; and your affection is&mdash;er&mdash;Skinner,
      you human icicle, you can't bluff me! I'm on to you, young feller! Matt,
      you prepare a deed of gift for one-half of my two-thirds interest to
      Skinner, and take the other half for yourself; and when the <i>Alden M.
      Peasley</i> has earned what I put into her, credit my account with it.
      After that, you and Skinner and Gus Redell and Live Wire Luiz can collect
      the dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ricks! This is too much,&rdquo; Skinner began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, sir! Not a peep out of you, sir! How dare you argue with me?
      Now just one word more before you fellers go: The next time you boys go
      bidding on a ship at auction, take a leaf out of Cappy Ricks' book and bid
      against yourself! You can always scare the other fellows off that way; the
      sky is the limit&mdash;and you're bound to get your money back. So you
      should <i>Ish ka bibble</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you two young freshies go back to your desks and try to learn
      humility. Thus endeth the first lesson, my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley came close to Cappy and put his big arm round the little old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cappy,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;please don't retire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, son,&rdquo; Cappy answered; &ldquo;but get that infernal cry-baby,
      Skinner, out of my office. He's breaking my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If J. Augustus Redell had been content to sue for peace following his deal
      with Cappy in Australian wheat, all would have been well for that young
      man. Alas! As we have already stated, he was young&mdash;and there is an
      old saying to the effect that youth must be served. J. Augustus Redell,
      like Oliver Twist, desired more. His triumph over Cappy in the wheat deal
      merely whetted his desire for more of the Ricks blood, and in the end the
      ingenious rascal evolved a plan for making Cappy the laughing stock of the
      Bilgewater Club for a month of Sundays.

      CHAPTER XLIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MONSIEUR LE CAPITAINE RICKS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks entered his office at the unheard-of hour of eight-thirty. On
      his way to his sanctum at the end of the long suite of offices Cappy
      paused in the lair of Mr. Skinner, who looked up, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he saluted the president emeritus. &ldquo;What brings you down on the
      job so early this morning, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a hen on,&rdquo; Cappy replied briskly. He glanced at Skinner and
      rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;this is
      a one-horse concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three sawmills with a combined output of a million feet a day on a
      ten-hour shift&mdash;not to mention a billion feet of stumpage&mdash;isn't
      my idea of a one-horse concern,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner retorted with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, Skinner! I'm not referring to the lumber end at all; so don't
      get touchy. I'm referring to the Blue Star Navigation Company. It's a
      dinky proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-two vessels&mdash;windjammers, steam schooners and foreign-going
      freighters&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Skinner; but Cappy cut him short:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foreign-going grandmothers! We've got the <i>Narcissus</i> and the <i>Tillicum</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about my boat&mdash;the <i>John P. Skinner?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! That one we scraped up off the bottom of Papeete Harbor,&rdquo; Cappy
      answered maliciously. &ldquo;Well, that makes three; and really the <i>Skinner</i>
      and the <i>Narcissus</i> are the only vessels built to go foreign.
      Remember, Skinner, we built the <i>Tillicum</i>, for the coast-wise lumber
      trade, even though she's so big our competitors thought when we launched
      her we were crazy to build such a whale for that trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to have more big bottoms, Skinner. We'll have hell-cracking
      freight rates during the war and for a long time thereafter&mdash;and here
      we sit round like a lot of dubs, too conservative to help ourselves to the
      gravy. Why, you and Matt Peasley ought to be knitting socks in an old
      ladies' home, for all the progressiveness you're displaying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in charge of the shipping end, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you've got a tongue in your head, haven't you? You were
      practically in charge of the Blue Star for more than six months&mdash;during
      the entire period Matt was at sea in the <i>Retriever</i> and we thought
      he was a goner. Why, dog-gone you, Skinner, even when you thought Matt was
      dead you didn't suggest increasing the fleet. I'm surprised, Skinner, my
      boy, that in my old age, after gathering a lot of young fellows round me
      to carry on the business, I've still got to be the bell mare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner had nothing to say to this; if he had it is doubtful whether
      he would have said it, for he had been too long with Cappy Ricks not to
      know the signs when the old gentleman took the bit in his teeth and
      declared for a new deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going into my office to do some tall thinking, Skinner,&rdquo; Cappy
      continued. &ldquo;Remember! No visitors until I've threshed this whole business
      out to my satisfaction. I'm not in to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy retired to his office, sat down on his spine in his upholstered
      swivel chair, swung his thin old shanks to the top of his desk, bowed his
      head on his breast, and closed his eyes. Scarcely had he done so when the
      door opened and Matt Peasley thrust his head in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matt?&rdquo; Cappy queried without opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an offer of forty thousand dollars for our old bark <i>Altair</i>,
      Cappy. What do you think we ought to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled. &ldquo;You jibbering jackdaw! Grab it! She's been a
      failure since the day I built her; never balanced, always burying her nose
      in the seas, and drowning a sailor about once a year. If we keep that ship
      much longer she'll sail herself under some day and we'll be out the forty
      thousand. <i>Altair!</i> Fancy name! Skinner got it out of Ben Hur. He'd
      been in the shipping game ten years then and hadn't learned that was the
      name of a star! We should have called her the <i>Water Spaniel</i>. Sell
      her, Matt, and we'll put the money into a steamer that can run foreign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can tell me where we can buy, even at three times her intrinsic
      value, a steamer that will run foreign, I'm willing to consider selling
      the <i>Altair</i>. Just at present she's earning big dividends; and until
      we can find a place to invest her selling price, the money will earn six
      per cent instead of sixty, as at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear out and let me think!&rdquo; Cappy commanded, and Matt Peasley retired to
      Mr. Skinner's office.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed the old gentleman lately?&rdquo; he inquired of Skinner. &ldquo;Ever
      since his grandson arrived grandpa has been paying attention to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dissatisfied with his own and our efforts thus far. He thinks he's
      been a piker and that you and I are his first-assistant pikers. He has
      ships on the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's getting pretty cocky,&rdquo; Matt agreed; &ldquo;but, at that, I guess he has a
      license to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been with him twenty-six&mdash;yes, twenty-seven&mdash;years; and I
      know him, Matt. He's cooking up something prodigious&mdash;and it will
      soon be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of Cappy's office opened and Cappy stood in the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;get me a letter of credit for about twenty
      thousand dollars. I'm going travelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Matt and Skinner queried in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not!&rdquo; Matt Peasley declared. &ldquo;You're liable to be torpedoed en
      route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but then, too, I'm liable not to be; and if I am, why, I'm an old
      man, and I'll only be cheating the devil by a few years or a few months.
      Come in here, you two dead ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed him into his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need some steamers,&rdquo; Cappy announced. &ldquo;Every shipyard in the United
      States that could build the kind of steamer we want is full up with
      contracts for the next three years; so I'm going to Norway or Sweden or
      Denmark, or some non-belligerent European country, and see whether I can't
      place some contracts there for a couple of real freighters. Then, too, I
      may be able to pick up good vessels over there at a reasonable price.
      Under the Emergency Shipping Act we can get them provisional American
      registry&mdash;and that's all we need. Before a great while Uncle Sam is
      going to turn his antiquated shipping laws inside out, and any
      foreign-built boats we may acquire now will be given the right to run in
      the coastwise trade also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Cappy,&rdquo; Matt reminded the old man; &ldquo;you're retired and I'm in
      charge of the destinies of the Blue Star Navigation Company. I don't want
      you working yourself to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you don't want me butting in. Nonsense! What's the use of having
      a grandson if a fellow doesn't hustle up something for the boy to sharpen
      his teeth on when he grows up? Here I've been living from day to day, just
      marking time on the road to eternity and figuring life wasn't worth while
      because the stock was going to die out with me. Up until recently I was
      content with a little old one-horse business; but now, by the Holy
      Pink-Toed Prophet, boy, we've got to get out and shake a leg! Freighters!
      That's what we want. Big, well-decked tramps, flying the Stars and Stripes
      in every port on earth. Why, what kind of a nation are we getting to be,
      anyway? We're a passel of mollycoddles, asleep on the job. We haven't half
      enough ships to coal our navy. In the event of war it would take us a week
      to dig up ships enough to transport the New York Police Department. I tell
      you, Matt, when I'm gone you'll have to have something for that grandson
      of mine to do or he'll grow up into one of these idle-rich, ne'er-do-well,
      two-for-a-quarter dudes. You bet I've been doing a deal of thinking
      lately. We can't send that boy to college, and spoil him before he's
      twenty-five. We'll run that young man through high school; just about that
      time he'll begin to get snobbish and we'll take that out of him by sending
      him to sea as a cadet on one of our own ships. We'll teach him democracy&mdash;that's
      what we'll teach him. When he's twenty-one he'll be a skipper like his
      forebears and you'll be only about forty-six. Good Lord! To think of you
      two young fellows running my Blue Star ships&mdash;and not enough ships to
      keep you busy! Preposterous! I can't consider&mdash;Well, Hankins, my dear
      boy, what's troubling you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hankins, the secretary, had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see Mr. Skinner a moment. I'll wait. Didn't know you were
      busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he started to retire. Cappy checked him: &ldquo;Finish with Skinner,
      Hankins. He'll be in consultation here with Matt and me for an hour yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to know, Mr. Skinner, whether all those cablegrams to
      Captain Landry, of the <i>Altair</i>, are to be charged to general
      expense, Captain Landry's personal account, or to the <i>Altair</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me you should charge them to Captain Landry, Hankins,&rdquo; Mr.
      Skinner spoke up. &ldquo;It isn't ship's business and it isn't Blue Star
      business. If he wants this office to cable him every day about his family&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! What's this you're talking about, Skinner?&rdquo; Cappy interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Captain Landry sailed for Callao his wife didn't accompany him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky rascal! He told me he was expecting an heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's still expecting that heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Mr. Hankins explained, &ldquo;he's been anxious for news; and ever
      since his arrival in Callao he's cabled us every other day&mdash;latterly
      every day&mdash;asking whether the baby has been born, and whether it's a
      boy or a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pardonable human curiosity, my boy. Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately the baby appears to be held up on demurrage and I think
      we've spent at least fifty dollars cabling to Landry that the youngster
      has failed to report. I imagine the skipper has spent twice that sum
      inquiring for news&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! It's his first baby, isn't it? You must allow for human
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we would&mdash;for the first half dozen cablegrams; but after
      it became a habit it appeared that Landry ought to pay for his fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner declared firmly. &ldquo;Charge the cablegrams to
      Landry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; piped Cappy. &ldquo;Charge 'em to general expense. Dang you,
      Skinner, I despair of ever breaking you of that habit of operating on the
      cheap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, sir&mdash;only the expense is getting to be quite an
      item.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just about to send him another cablegram,&rdquo; Mr. Hankins declared
      fretfully. &ldquo;The <i>Altair</i> is due to sail from Callao and the baby is
      still unborn; it will be two months old, at least, before the skipper gets
      any further news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see your cablegram,&rdquo; Cappy ordered, and Mr. Hankins passed it over.
      Cappy read it. &ldquo;Holy suffering sailor!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why this concern isn't
      in the hands of a receiver is a mystery to me.&rdquo; He looked up at Mr.
      Hankins with blood in his eye. &ldquo;Here you are, Hankins, trying to saddle a
      bill of expense on a poor, heartbroken, anxious, embryo parent-to-be.
      Knowing full well that he only makes a hundred and fifty dollars a month,
      you admit to an endeavor to stick him for fifty dollars' worth of
      cablegrams from this end, not to mention those from his end. If you had
      spent your time, sir, figuring out a way to cut down that cable expense,
      instead of discovering a rotten way to get rid of it&mdash;Why, look here!
      You can use your code book and save a couple of dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Code book!&rdquo; Mr. Hankins protested indignantly. &ldquo;Why, who ever heard of a
      code book for cabling on baby business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use your shipping code. Here; hand me that code book. There's bound to be
      something to fit the occasion&mdash;there always is. Hum-m-m! Ahem!
      Harumph-h-h! Let us see what we shall see under the head of cargoes;
      Loading! Discharging! Demurrage! Ahem! That won't do. He'd be liable to
      confuse it with the ship's business. Harumph-h-h! Arrivals. Now we have
      it. Landry has been asking of an expected arrival, hasn't he?&rdquo; Cappy ran
      his index finger down the page. &ldquo;Here you are, Hankins. Hum-m-m! Afilamos&mdash;meaning
      no new arrivals. Naturally Landry will say to himself: 'Well, for heaven's
      sake, when will that child arrive?' We should enlighten him on that
      point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Say so. Here you are. Affumicata&mdash;meaning: We
      cannot guarantee time of arrival. Hankins, have you talked with Mrs.
      Landry's physician in order to get the latest ringside reports?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he says he thinks it will be twins, in a couple of days at the
      most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! Here you are. Afilaba&mdash;meaning: Heavy arrivals expected
      shortly. Now then, Hankins, he'll want some news of his wife, won't he?
      How about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went to the hospital this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy closed his eyes and pondered; then once more took up the code book.
      Followed a silence. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully! He'll understand perfectly, being a sailor. Desdoble&mdash;meaning:
      Is now in dry dock. And, of course, Landry will want to know whether his
      wife is in any danger. Danger! Danger! Ships are sometimes in danger.
      When? When they're wrecked, of course. Let us look under the head of
      wrecks... No; nothing seems to fill the bill. Wreck, wrecked, worse, writ,
      write, wrong&mdash;ah, I have it! Wohlgemuth&mdash;meaning: There is
      nothing wrong.&rdquo; He looked up at Mr. Hankins. &ldquo;Now there's the kind of
      cablegram to send&mdash;even on baby business. Those four code words
      translated mean: No new arrivals; heavy arrivals expected shortly; is now
      in dry dock; there is nothing wrong. Literally translated it means: Baby
      not born yet; twins expected shortly; your wife now in hospital;
      everything lovely! I suppose, Hankins, you have carbon copies of all these
      cablegrams you've been sending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Code them all, so far as possible, and ascertain how much money you might
      have saved the Blue Star by the exercise of a little common sense; then
      charge the cablegrams, on the coded basis, to our general expense, and
      charge to your personal account the sum you might have saved by the
      exercise of the ingenuity and efficiency I have a right to expect of a man
      who draws down as fat a salary as you do.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER L
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Hankins withdrew, greatly crestfallen, and the despot of the Blue Star
      office turned to his trusted lieutenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;one after the other you have to come to the old man
      to be shown. I guess I've proved to you two boys this morning that I'm to
      be trusted with buying a few ships and letting contracts for a few more,
      haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like the idea of Cappy Ricks on a steamer that's likely to be
      torpedoed. I don't want you to go to Europe alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going alone. Captain Mike Murphy, our new port captain, is going
      with me. I wouldn't think of buying a steamer unless that splendid fellow
      O.K.'d the hull. And Terry Reardon, our new port engineer, will accompany
      me also. Terry has to O.K. the engines. Between the three of us, it's
      going to take a smart trader to sell us any junk, I'm telling you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to go with you,&rdquo; Matt suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your work at home, attending to the fleet. It isn't much of a
      fleet, I'll admit; but such as it is it requires some attention. I'll be
      the chief scout of this organization and see whether I can't rustle up
      some major-league vessels from some of those bush-league European owners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a fine time getting good men to take their places in the <i>Narcissus</i>
      since you promoted Mike and Terry in my absence!&rdquo; Matt complained. &ldquo;Mike
      and Terry know her well&mdash;and she's such a big brute to handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the <i>Narcissus</i>, by the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loading nitrate at Tocopilla and Antofagasta, Chile. This is her last
      voyage under the old charter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any new business in sight for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't have the slightest difficulty getting another nitrate charter and
      at a rate double what she's been getting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every vessel taken off the nitrate run stiffens the freight rate in these
      days, when they have to have so much nitrate in the manufacture of war
      munitions,&rdquo; the astute Cappy declared. &ldquo;If I were you, Matt, I'd find her
      a good outside cargo or two, and then slip her back in the nitrate
      business again. Freights may have advanced in the interim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mighty profitable cargo offered me this morning, Cappy. An agent
      of the British Government called on me and offered a whopping price for
      carrying a cargo of mules and horses from Galveston to Havre. I think I
      shall turn the proposition down. It's too dangerous, Cappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean we might have our ship blown up by a German submarine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'd collect our freight in advance, wouldn't we? And the British
      Government will guarantee to reimburse us if the ship is lost, will it
      not? Well, then, where's the risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the danger to the crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man that goes to sea knows he has to take a chance. Bet you Mike
      Murphy could take that cargo of livestock across and bring another cargo
      back. He's luckier than a cross-eyed coon. And another thing, Matt: If you
      accept that business we can kill two birds with one stone&mdash;yes, three&mdash;because
      Mike and Terry and I will cross over on the <i>Narcissus</i> and save the
      price of transportation from here to New York, and from New York to
      Liverpool. Then, while the <i>Narcissus</i> is discharging and taking on
      another cargo, we'll go scouting for available steamers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be done, though I hate to think of it Cappy. If we lose the
      vessel they'll pay us a million and a half for her, of course&mdash;and
      she cost us less than three hundred thousand a year ago. And, as you say,
      we'll collect the freight in advance. They're very anxious to get the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      She's a whopping big boat, and that's the kind of a vessel they need for a
      horse transport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and, by the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, it will be a bully vacation, and
      a bully vacation is something I haven't had since the night of the big
      wind in Ireland. Moreover, I combine business with pleasure, which is
      always desirable; and, if that isn't excuse enough, I want to tell you
      it's cheaper to travel dead-head on our own boats than to pay for three
      round-trip tickets to Europe on a Cunard liner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose a German submarine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, all my life I've played a quiet, safe, sane, conservative game.
      I've always longed for adventure and never had it. Why, just consider a
      moment what a tiresome thing life would be were it not for the prospect of
      death at any moment! That's all that keeps us hustling, my boy&mdash;trying
      to put over a winning run before the game is called on account of
      darkness. Hell's bells! Don't try to scare me with a sheet and the rattle
      of old bones. Suppose they do blow us up? We don't lose a dollar; in fact,
      we make money&mdash;and we can take to the boats, can't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They only give you fifteen minutes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have the boats swung overside, provisioned and ready, two days
      ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they don't care how far out to sea they leave you. I spent two weeks
      in an open boat once and I know you can't stand two days. The exposure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get down to Galveston,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted triumphantly, &ldquo;I'll
      have Mike Murphy buy a nice, staunch little secondhand motor cruiser,
      thirty-eight or forty feet long, with plenty of power and comfortable
      living accommodations for half a dozen people. Mike will arrange for extra
      oil and gasoline tankage, and we'll swing this cruiser in on the main deck
      and let it rest there in a cradle, with the slings round it, ready to lift
      overside with the cargo derricks at a minute's notice. I'll be as snug in
      that little cruiser as a bug under a chip&mdash;and we'll tow the
      lifeboats. So that settles it&mdash;and if it doesn't I'd like to know
      who's the boss of this shebang, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner glanced covertly at Captain Matt Peasley and shook his head
      almost imperceptibly, as who should say: &ldquo;Better give in to him, Matt. I
      know him longer than you do; he'll have his way if it kills him.&rdquo; And Matt
      took the hint, with the result that some six weeks later Cappy Ricks,
      accompanied by his faithful port captain and his equally faithful port
      engineer, cleared for Galveston aboard the Sunset Limited. And at
      Galveston began the only real vacation Cappy Ricks had ever had.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin, there was the task of superintending the installation of the
      accommodations for the cargo of mules and horses. Cappy was particularly
      interested in the ventilating system below decks, for he was fond of
      horses and had resolved to deliver the cargo without the loss of a single
      animal. Of no mediocre turn of mind mechanically, he, assisted by Terry
      Reardon, made a few suggestions that the British veterinaries in charge
      were very glad to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real enjoyment of the trip, however, Cappy found down at the breaking
      corrals where the horses were detraining. They were all young and full of
      life, and fully ninety per cent of them had only been halter-broken. In
      the lot was many an outlaw whose ancestors had run wild for generations in
      Nevada; and as the delivery contract specified that a horse to be accepted
      must be broken&mdash;God save the mark!&mdash;as Terence Reardon remarked
      after seeing one passed as broken, following five minutes of furious
      pitching and squealing&mdash;Cappy Ricks was one of the first at the
      corral and the last to leave. Perched on the topmost, rail, he piped
      encouragement to the lank, flat-bellied border busters who, a dozen times
      a day, risked life and limb at five dollars a bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy and Terence Reardon, who had ridden more than one China Sea
      typhoon and West India hurricane, marvelled that men should take such
      risks for any amount of money. Privately they considered Cappy Ricks an
      accessory before the fact, inasmuch as Cappy hung up at least five hundred
      dollars in small prizes for the vaqueros. Whenever they had a &ldquo;bad one&rdquo;
       they could always induce Cappy to offer ten dollars for staying two
      minutes and five dollars a minute for each minute over the limit&mdash;which
      seldom reached two minutes. Also, Cappy was willing to furnish two silver
      dollars whenever some adventurer thought he could put a dollar between
      each leg and the saddle and have the dollars there when the horse
      surrendered. They ran in a couple of trained buckers on Cappy and depleted
      his bank roll considerably before he began to smell a rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these plainsmen, charged with the destinies of the mounts for the young
      British soldier, Cappy Ricks was known familiarly as Cap. Before the last
      of the horses had been passed as broken and hustled aboard the big <i>Narcissus</i>,
      Cappy knew each horse wrangler by his first name or nickname, and had
      learned the intricacies of many hitherto unheard-of games of chance that
      flourish along the Rio Grande. He was an expert at cooncan, and Pangingi
      fascinated him; then they taught him Mexican monte, and one worthless
      individual stole an ace out of the deck, whereupon all hands had a joyous
      hack at Cappy, who, when informed privately by his friend, Sam Daniels,
      foreman of the outfit, that he was in bad company and being skinned alive,
      went uptown and bought some specially constructed dice, which he
      introduced brazenly into a crap game, thereby more than catching even. He
      was the last man in the world a gang of wicked cowboys would suspect of
      guile; all of them, quite foolishly, thought he had more money than
      brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, however, the <i>Narcissus</i> was loaded, Cappy moved into the
      owner's suite, and his new-found friends bunked in a temporary deck house
      forward when they weren't busy below decks playing chambermaid to the
      cargo. And with Cappy's motor cruiser swung in the cradle, ready for
      launching from the main deck aft, the <i>Narcissus</i> slipped out of
      Galveston and went snoring across the Gulf of Mexico, bound for Le Havre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy was not happy, however. He resented Cappy Ricks, who would
      persist in going below to inspect the cargo and in consequence smelled
      like a hostler. Moreover, Michael was the port captain of the Blue Star
      Navigation Company now and not the master of the ship; and the <i>Narcissus</i>
      wasn't out of sight of land before Mike made the discovery that the
      boatswain of the ship was absolutely inefficient, that the cook was
      wasteful, that the first officer was too talkative, and the skipper too
      easy-going.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these conditions, on a ship he had once commanded, irked Murphy
      exceedingly. Terence Reardon was in much the same state of mind. Being
      port engineer, he investigated the engine room and found that his favorite
      monkey wrench had been lost; there were two leaky tubes in the main
      boiler; the ash hoist was out of kilter; his successor in the <i>Narcissus</i>
      was carrying ten pounds of steam less than Terence used to carry; and
      there was something not quite right with the condenser. The engine room
      crew Terence characterized to Mike Murphy as a gang of &ldquo;vagabones,&rdquo; and
      hinted darkly at sweeping changes when the ship should get back to the
      United States. Once he went so far as to state that he might have expected
      as much when, upon leaving the <i>Narcissus</i> to become port engineer,
      he had given her to his old first assistant; since he had never known a
      first assistant, barring himself, to make a good chief!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the very day the <i>Narcissus</i> left Galveston the German submersible
      V-l4 left her base at Zeebrugge, with oil and torpedoes sufficient to last
      her on an ordinary three weeks' cruise, and promptly headed for that
      section of the Atlantic where information and belief told her commander
      the hunting would be good. And it was&mdash;so good, in fact, that to the
      very great disgust of her crew she had just two torpedoes in stock when
      the man on watch at her periscope reported a large freight steamer to the
      west. Promptly the V-l4 submerged and proceeded on a course calculated to
      intercept the freighter, which presently was discovered to be the U.S.S.
      <i>Narcissus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the V-l4 almost licked his chops. He had heard of the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      The neutrality laws of the United States had prevented him from hearing of
      her by wireless when she cleared from Galveston, but he had been on the
      lookout for her, just the same, ever since a Dutch steamer from New York,
      with an alert German chief mate, had touched at Copenhagen, from which
      point the dispatches that mate carried had gone underground straight to
      the office of the German Admiralty. The information anent the <i>Narcissus</i>
      had been brief but illuminating: She had been chartered to carry horses
      for the British Government from Galveston to Le Havre, and the word to get
      her at all hazards had been passed to the submarine flotilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Emil Bechtel, of the V-l4, did not possess an Iron Cross of any
      nature whatsoever, and as he studied the oncoming <i>Narcissus</i> through
      the periscope he reflected that this big brute of a boat would bring him
      one, provided he was lucky. He remembered he had but two torpedoes left,
      and under the circumstances he paused to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly&mdash;since the <i>Narcissus</i> was laden with horses and mules
      for the enemy she was carrying contraband&mdash;she must not escape. On
      the other hand, there had been a deal of unpleasantness of late because
      President Wilson had been protesting the sinking of vessels without
      warning&mdash;and the <i>Narcissus</i> was a United States steamer.
      Consequently if he torpedoed her without warning the temperamental Kaiser
      might make of Captain Emil Bechtel what is colloquially known as the goat;
      whereas, on the other hand, should he conform to international law and
      place her crew in safety before sinking her, there was a chance that her
      wireless might summon a patrol boat to the vicinity&mdash;Bechtel had
      sighted one less than an hour before&mdash;and patrol boats had a
      miserable habit, when they sighted a periscope, of shooting it to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, it was just possible that the perfidious English had mounted a
      couple of six-inch guns on her after getting to sea&mdash;and the German
      knew a six-inch shell, well-placed, would send his vessel to the bottom.
      Moreover, it was sunset; in half an hour it would be twilight; he had no
      knowledge of the speed of the <i>Narcissus</i> and she might try to make a
      run for it, thus forcing him to come to the surface and shell her should
      he miss with his torpedoes. Further, if he attacked her and she escaped,
      there was an elderly gentleman with whiskers back in Berlin who would do
      things to him if the Kaiser didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, one course open to the German. To his way of thinking,
      during the exciting diplomatic tangle with the United States, he would be
      damned if he did and damned if he didn't; but if he did, and nobody could
      prove it, old Von Tirpitz would ask no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let her have it,&rdquo; Captain Emil Bechtel concluded; and he passed the
      word to get ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later Cappy Ricks, smoking his after-dinner cigar on the bridge
      of the Narcissus with her skipper and Mike Murphy, pointed far off the
      port bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a shark or a swordfish, or something, breaching,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can
      see his wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy took a casual glance in the direction Cappy was pointing,
      while the master of the <i>Narcissus</i> reached for his marine glasses
      and lazily put them to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shark be damned!&rdquo; yelled Murphy. &ldquo;It's a torpedo or I'm a Chinaman!
      Hard-a-starboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped for the engine-room telegraph and jammed it over to Full Speed
      Astern; then dashed into the pilot house and commenced a furious ringing
      of the ship's bell, summoning the crew to boat drill, the while his
      anxious eye marked the swift progress of the white streak coming toward
      them. What wind there was happened fortunately to be on the vessel's port
      counter, and as the helmsman spun the wheel the big vessel fell off
      quickly and easily, while the rumble of her shaft, suddenly reversed,
      fairly shook the ship. To Cappy Ricks it seemed that the vessel must be
      brought up standing, like one of the broncos he had seen ridden with a
      Spanish bit; but a big ship under full headway is not stopped very
      abruptly, and the <i>Narcissus</i> swept on, turning as she went in order
      to offer as little target as possible to the torpedo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we make it, Mike?&rdquo; Cappy Ricks queried in a very small, awed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy turned and found his owner at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it hits her forward,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That motor cruiser is cradled
      aft and we might save it. They never hailed us&mdash;ah-h-h, missed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The torpedo flew by, missing the big blunt bow by less than three feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they'll get us just the same,&rdquo; Mike Murphy murmured quietly; &ldquo;but
      we're going down fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, disregarding the master of the <i>Narcissus</i>, who was staring
      vacantly after the flying torpedo, he rang for Full Speed Ahead, and
      called down the speaking tube to the chief to hook her on for all he had;
      then, with his helm still hard-a-starboard, he swung the ship in as small
      a circle as possible and headed her at full speed back over the course so
      recently traveled by the torpedo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a beautifully timed shot&mdash;that last one,&rdquo; he informed Cappy
      Ricks admiringly. &ldquo;If we'd sighted it thirty seconds later&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil are you going, man?&rdquo; Cappy yelled frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to give that fellow a surprise,&rdquo; Murphy growled. &ldquo;He expected
      us to run for it after that first one missed&mdash;and I'm running for
      him! He may not get me with the next one if I come bows on&mdash;and I
      might ram him! I'll take a chance. Keep your eyes open for his periscope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aboard the V-l4 Captain Emil Bechtel said nothing, but thought a great
      deal&mdash;when he saw that his first torpedo had missed its prey. He was
      in for it now; he had started something and he had to go through. And,
      anticipating that the <i>Narcissus</i> would show him her heels and steer
      a zigzag course, he immediately launched his last torpedo as the horse
      transport lay quartering to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his disgust, however, the steamer, having avoided the first torpedo,
      did not run as he had anticipated. Instead, she continued to turn round on
      her heels, each revolution of her wheel lifting her out of the course of
      the second torpedo, since the submarine had fired slightly ahead of the
      vessel, knowing that if she continued for two minutes on the course he
      expected her to take she would steam fairly across the path of the huge
      missile. So he missed again&mdash;the torpedo slid under her stern&mdash;and
      here was that demon horse transport bearing down on him at full speed and
      with a bone in her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jig is up,&rdquo; murmured Bechtel, and gave the order to submerge deeper,
      for he would not risk showing his periscope to the keen eyes on that
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes he waited, while the submarine scuttled blindly out of the
      path of the onrushing transport; then, concluding that the <i>Narcissus</i>
      had passed him, he came up and took a look round. He was right. A cable
      length astern and another off his port quarter the steamer was plunging
      over the darkening sea, and Captain Emil Bechtel knew he had her now; so
      promptly he came to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy, glancing off his starboard quarter, saw her periscope come
      swiftly up; then her turret showed; then her turtle deck flashed for a
      moment on the surface, like a giant fish, before she rose higher and the
      water cascaded down her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks' anxious face turned a delicate green; he glanced up at his
      bully port captain as if in that rugged personality alone could he hope
      for salvation. Murphy caught the glance, shook his head, walked over to
      the engine-room telegraph and set the handle over to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, sir,&rdquo; he informed Cappy. &ldquo;That Dutchman is out of torpedoes, so
      he's coming up to shell us. We'll heave to and save funeral expenses.&rdquo; He
      turned to the master of the <i>Narcissus</i>. &ldquo;Captain, I'll stay on the
      bridge and conduct all negotiations with that fellow; get your mates,
      round up everybody and prepare to abandon the ship in a hurry. Get the
      motor cruiser overside first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the captain hurried away, Terence Reardon came up on the bridge. The
      port engineer's gloomy visage portended tears, but through his narrowed
      lids Cappy Ricks saw not tears, but the light of murder. Terence did not
      speak, but thoughtfully puffed his pipe, and, with Murphy and Cappy Ricks,
      watched the booby hatch on the submarine's deck slide back and her long,
      slim, three-inch gun appear, like the tongue of a huge viper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heads appeared round the breech of the gun; so Michael J. Murphy seized a
      megaphone and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nein! Nix!</i>&rdquo; accompanying his words with wild pantomime that meant
      &ldquo;Don't shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Emil Bechtel was vastly relieved. He was not an inhuman man, even
      if, on occasion, as has already been demonstrated, he could, for the sake
      of national expediency, sink a ship without warning. Having missed with
      both torpedoes, he could now, in the event of national complications,
      enter a vigorous denial of any affidavits alleging an attempted breach of
      international law, and his government would uphold him. This knowledge
      rendered him both cheerful and polite, as he hove to some hundred yards to
      starboard of the <i>Narcissus</i> and informed Captain Michael J. Murphy
      that the latter had just fifteen minutes in which to save the ship's
      company; whereat Michael J. proved himself every inch a sailor, while
      Terence P. proved himself a marine engineer. If there was a word of
      opprobrium, mundane or nautical, which the port skipper didn't shout at
      that submarine commander, the port engineer supplied it. In all his life
      Cappy Ricks had never listened to such rich, racy, unctuous abuse; it
      lifted itself about the level of the commonplace and became a work of art.
      Cappy was horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys! Boys!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;This is frightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect from a German, sir?&rdquo; Murphy demanded. &ldquo;Frightfulness
      is his middle name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you two&mdash;and your language. Stop it! You'll contaminate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sor,&rdquo; Terence Reardon replied philosophically, &ldquo;I suppose there's
      small use cryin' over spilt milk&mdash;musha, what are they up to now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're dragging a collapsible boat up from below,&rdquo; Mike Murphy declared.
      &ldquo;That means they're going to board us, place bombs in the bilges, and sink
      us that way. They know blamed well we've wirelessed for help and a patrol
      has answered; so that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No profanity!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he has decided he won't try to sink us by shell fire with such a small
      gun. It'll be dark in five minutes and he's afraid the flame of the
      discharge or the reports of the gun may guide the patrol boat here before
      he's finished his job. Oh, wirra, wirra!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murphy's surmise proved to be correct, for he had scarcely finished
      speaking before the submarine commander hailed him and ordered him to let
      down his gangway. Terence P. Reardon's eyes flamed with the lust for
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the great gun av Athlone,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if they're comin' aboard sure we
      can get at them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murphy's rage vanished as suddenly as it had gripped him; he smiled at
      Terence affectionately, approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You with your monkey wrench, eh, Terry, my lad? And they with automatic
      pistols and wishful of an excuse to use them, not to mention the
      nitroglycerin and guncotton bombs they'll be carrying&mdash;a divilish bad
      thing to have kicking round in a free-for-all fight?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry's face showed his deep disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll see us all in the boats,&rdquo; Murphy continued; &ldquo;then they'll go
      below, set the bombs, light a slow fuse to give them time to get back to
      the submarine&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all these poor dumb beasts aboard?&rdquo; Cappy Ricks quavered. &ldquo;Horrible!
      Horrible! I could kill them for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could kill them for a greater crime than that,&rdquo; his port captain
      reminded him. &ldquo;Didn't they try twice to sink us without warning? Damn
      them! They're forty fathoms outside the law this minute.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life Cappy Ricks was in financial and physical
      danger coincidently. Old he was, and a landlubber, for all his courtesy
      title; but in his veins there coursed the blood of a long line of fighting
      ancestors. It occurred to him now that in all his life he had never cried
      &ldquo;Enough;&rdquo; that always, when cornered and presumably beaten, he had gone
      into executive session with himself and, fox that he was, schemed a way
      out. In this supreme moment there came to him now the words of the gallant
      Lawrence: &ldquo;Don't give up the ship!&rdquo; They inspired him; his agile old
      brain, benumbed by the shock of the exciting events of the last quarter of
      an hour, threw off its paralysis; his little five-feet-four body thrilled
      with the impact of a sudden brilliant idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he piped. &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, it might be done!
      Mike, the submarine lies to starboard. Tell the mate to lower the port
      gangway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murphy ran out on the end of the bridge and bawled the order. Then he came
      back, and he and Terence and Cappy Ricks put their heads together while in
      brief, illuminating sentences Cappy Ricks unfolded the fruit of his
      genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he pleaded when he had finished, &ldquo;is that scheme practicable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be done, sir,&rdquo; Mike Murphy assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll thry anything the wanst,&rdquo; Terry Reardon almost barked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means some fighting&mdash;probably some killing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra wan av me'll feel broken-hearted at killin' the likes av that
      Dutchman,&rdquo; Terry answered. &ldquo;Shtill, we'll be needin' some help, I'm
      thinkin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get it, or I'm no judge of human nature. Mike, pass the word for
      Sam Daniels, the boss of muleteers and broncho busters. Sam used to be a
      Texas Ranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly Sam Daniels was sent for and arrived on the jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Cappy calmly, &ldquo;I'm enlisting volunteers to raise
      hell with that submarine. They're going to put bombs in the bilges and
      blow up the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count me in, Cap,&rdquo; Sam Daniels replied laconically. &ldquo;Want me to rustle up
      a couple of the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about three real ones&mdash;boys that are handy with a six-shooter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess most of the boys from the border have their guns in their war
      bags. I'll go get them together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did&mdash;in about three minutes; by which time the collapsible boat
      from the submarine had been launched and was pulling toward the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      While her master directed them to pull round to the port gangway, Sam
      Daniels slipped down unobserved into Number Three hatch, two of his horse
      wranglers disappeared with an equal lack of ostentation down the gangway
      into Number Two hatch, and a third man went forward and down Number One.
      The trap was set.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout young lieutenant clad in soiled dungarees, his uniform cap alone
      denoting his rank, came briskly up the companion, followed by four jackies
      carrying the bombs. A fifth man remained in the boat, fending it away with
      a boat hook from the tall black side of the <i>Narcissus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who commands here?&rdquo; the German demanded in most excellent English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the master of the <i>Narcissus</i> replied, and stepped a pace
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hurry and get your boats overside. We're going to bomb the ship, and
      if anybody remains aboard when those bombs explode it will be his fault,
      not ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor cruiser had already been dropped overboard, and the life-boats,
      having been for two days swung out in the davits, were quickly filled and
      lowered away. As each boat pulled clear of the ship the man in charge of
      it was ordered by the submarine lieutenant to stay to port of the <i>Narcissus</i>,
      and to pull well clear of the ship before proceeding to pass the towing
      painters to the cruiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are all your men off the ship?&rdquo; the officer queried of the skipper as the
      latter entered the last boat and gave the order to lower away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All off; I've accounted for all of them,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German waited until the boat had slipped away in the gloom before
      turning to his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed!&rdquo; he said briefly; and, followed by his four men, he led the way
      down the cleated temporary gangway built diagonally down Number Three
      hatch to accommodate the horses when they had been led aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better to facilitate their progress, Terence Reardon had turned on all
      the electric lights in the ship, and the detail proceeded quickly to the
      lower hold, where they set two bombs and piled double-compressed baled hay
      round them, with the fuse leading out from under the bales. In addition to
      blowing a hole in the ship they were taking the added precaution of
      setting her afire after the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the spot where the bombs were set a long alleyway, lined on each side
      with the rumps of horses, each neatly boxed in a stall just wide enough
      and long enough to inclose him firmly and hold him on his feet in the
      event of rough weather, led forward and aft to the bulkheads. And in one
      of these stalls, close up against the rump of a horse he could trust, Sam
      Daniels, the ex-Texas Ranger, crouched, with one eye round the corner of
      the stall, calmly watching the grim proceedings. Something told him that,
      having arranged the bombs in that hold, the enemy would not light the
      fuses until he had set similar bombs at the bottom of the other hatches;
      then, all being in readiness, a man would be sent into each hold to light
      the fuse, scurry on deck, descend to the waiting boat, and be pulled clear
      of danger before the fuses should burn down to the fulminating caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Daniels waited until the men were about to pick up the remaining bombs
      and ascend to the deck; whereupon he stepped quietly out into the
      alleyway, a long-barreled forty-five in his hand, and pussyfooted swiftly
      toward the Germans, whose backs were now turned toward him. Halfway down
      the alleyway, on one of the heavy six-by-six-inch uprights temporarily set
      in to support the weight of the hundred mules on the deck above, was the
      electric switch controlling the circuit in that hold&mdash;and Sam Daniels
      reached up and turned it down. Instantly the hold was in darkness; and
      then the horseman spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, you Dutchies! Stay right where you are! I want to have a little
      powwow with you before you go any farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said this, the astute Mr. Daniels, out of a vast experience gained
      while fighting Mexicans and outlaws in the dark, promptly lay down. In
      case the enemy should become rattled and fire at the sound of his voice he
      preferred to have plenty of room for the bullets to pass over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; the lieutenant demanded in English; and by the firm,
      resolute voice the Texan knew that the German was not rattled and that his
      men would not fire unless he gave the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great thing, this naval discipline!&rdquo; Mr. Daniels soliloquized. Aloud he
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fastest, straightest little wing shot with a six shooter that ever
      was, old-timer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you purpose doing, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I purpose giving you some good advice; though whether you accept it or
      not is a matter of indifference to me. You will observe that this hold is
      in comparative darkness. I say comparative, because through the hatch
      space a certain amount of light is projected from the deck above, and you
      and your men are standing in that light, whereas I am in the dark. I can
      see you and you cannot see me. I have a forty-five caliber revolver in my
      hand and another in reserve. There are five of you fellows, constituting a
      fair target&mdash;and I seldom miss a fair target. I can kill all five of
      you in five seconds. Of course some of you may manage to fire at the flash
      of my gun and accidentally kill me; but&mdash;make no mistake about it,
      son&mdash;I'll get you and your gang before I kick the bucket. Now, then,
      which do you want to do&mdash;live or die? I'm going to be fair to you
      fellows and give you some choice in the matter&mdash;which is more than
      you did when you launched those two torpedoes at us. Speak up, brother!
      I'm a nervous man and dislike suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The German lieutenant glanced at his men, who had not yet touched the
      other bombs and were looking stolidly at him for orders. He licked his
      lower lip and scowled, sighed gustily&mdash;and made a swift grab for his
      automatic. A streak of flame came out of the dark alleyway and the
      German's arm hung limp at his side. He had a bullet in his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you I was a wing shot!&rdquo; the plainsman cautioned him pleasantly. &ldquo;I
      would have put that one through your heart if I didn't need an
      interpreter. I imagine these roustabouts with you only speak their mother
      tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, first, I want you to leave that high explosive right where it is.
      Then I want you to deposit all your sidearms on the floor, and have your
      men do likewise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The German had had his lesson and arrived at the conclusion that valor
      without discretion is not good business. He slipped his belt off and let
      it drop to the floor; at a word from him his men did likewise, whereupon
      Daniels stood up, threw on the electric switch, and revealed himself and
      his artillery to the gaze of the invaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward; in a bunch, up the gangway!&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed. As the Texan passed the little heap of belts, with the
      automatics in the holsters attached, he gathered them up and followed.
      Just before the procession reached the main deck he halted them and
      whistled&mdash;whereupon Michael J. Murphy, Terence P. Reardon and Cappy
      Ricks came to the edge of the hatch and peered over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look who's here!&rdquo; Cappy exclaimed maliciously. &ldquo;Five nice little
      pirates, who would sink my <i>Narcissus</i> without so much as a be-damned
      to you! Mike, bring the irons. Terence, my boy, restrain yourself. If you
      use that monkey wrench until I give the word the Blue Star Navigation
      Company will have a new port engineer. Undress these fellows. Just remove
      their caps and outer garments&mdash;and be quick about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them to molt&mdash;<i>muy pronto!</i>&rdquo; Sam Daniels ordered the
      lieutenant, who relayed the order in a voice that had in it a suspicion of
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three minutes they were undressed and handcuffed together; leg irons
      were put on them, and they were expeditiously gagged and chained to a
      stanchion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Terence, I have work for you and your monkey wrench,&rdquo; Cappy
      continued. &ldquo;You're about the same size as this officer. Into his dungarees
      and uniform cap; and don't forget to slip on his belt, with the
      automatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two shakes av a lamb's tail, sor. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you run down the gangway to the waiting boat, hold your handkerchief
      over that Irish mug of yours. Pretend you're blowing your nose. The man in
      the boat won't recognize you until you're on top of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wan little love tap&mdash;no more!&rdquo; Terence breathed lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Terence has tapped him, Sam,&rdquo; Cappy continued, &ldquo;you go down and help
      to get him out on the landing stage. He'll be off our hands there and the
      submarine people cannot see what's happened to him. They're still lying on
      our starboard beam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terence and the deadly Samuel disappeared, to return presently and report
      all well. Thereupon Michael J. Murphy retired to the port side of the
      house, lit a kerosene torch he had brought up from the engine room and
      waved it. He waited. Presently, in the gloom off to port, he saw the red
      and green side lights of the little cruiser. For a moment both lights were
      visible; then the master of the <i>Narcissus</i>, now in charge of the
      cruiser, ported his helm and showed his red only. Murphy waited, and
      presently both red and green showed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starboard now, and show your green,&rdquo; Murphy pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red went out and the green alone showed; so Mike Murphy extinguished
      his torch and rejoined Cappy Ricks, Terence and the ubiquitous Mr.
      Daniels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, my dear boy,&rdquo; Cappy was saying as Murphy came up, &ldquo;Mike and Terence
      own in the <i>Narcissus</i> and they work for me&mdash;hence their
      alliance. You owe me no fealty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell I don't, Cap!&rdquo; Sam retorted lightly. &ldquo;You're a fine old sport,
      and I'm for you till the last dog is hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, I am deeply grateful. Your friendship is very dear to me indeed. I
      have a twenty-two-thousand acre ranch down in Monterey County, California&mdash;don't
      know why I bought it, unless it was because it was a bargain and ranch
      property in California is bound to increase in value&mdash;and you're my
      foreman if we ever get out of this with a whole skin. I'll make it the
      best job you ever had, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Ricks!&rdquo; A moment before it had been Cap. &ldquo;If you never saw
      a man fight for a good job before, just watch me!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The horse tenders in the other holds were summoned and informed that for
      the present the <i>Narcissus</i> would not be bombed. Quickly two of them,
      with Mike Murphy and Sam Daniels, donned the dungarees and caps of the
      prisoners and strapped on their belts containing the automatics in their
      holsters. In the interim Terence had descended to the collapsible boat
      bumping at the gangway and fended her off until Sam Daniels, the two
      cowboys and Mike Murphy joined him; whereupon Terence took one pair of
      oars, while Murphy handled the other, and the boat crept out from the
      steamer and headed directly for the submarine, which had been ratching
      backward and forward under a dead-slow bell, watching the towering black
      hulk of the <i>Narcissus</i> rolling idly. A light showed on the turret of
      the submarine, outlining vaguely the figures of half a dozen men on her
      small deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disposition of Mike Murphy's forces was such that the chances of the
      enemy detecting the substitution of the boarding party before it should
      reach the submersible were reduced to a minimum. In the bow of the
      collapsible one of the cowboys sat, facing the stern; Terence and Mike
      also faced the stern, by reason of the fact that they were rowing; and Sam
      Daniels and the other cowboy, seated in the stern sheets, were under
      orders to turn and look back at the <i>Narcissus</i> as the boat came
      within the radius of the meager light from the submarine's turret. Thus
      they ran little risk of premature discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; as Cappy Ricks sagely reminded them just before they pulled away
      from the <i>Narcissus</i>, &ldquo;the German is both cautious and cocksure. The
      capture of his bombing party has been effected without a sound; the
      commander saw our men leave the steamer in the boats; he sees the <i>Narcissus</i>
      now not under command and wallowing; he figures that all is lovely and the
      goose honks high. Therefore, he will be off his guard, since his
      suspicions have not been roused. His deck is very dimly lighted by that
      single light on the turret, and he knows that light is sufficient to guide
      the boat party back to the submarine. There is no sea running to speak of;
      so it will not be necessary for him to turn his searchlight on you to
      light the way for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, he will not care to use his searchlight, because it may guide a
      patrol boat to this spot, and Terence has very carefully turned out all
      the lights on the ship which might be visible from a distance, because
      that is precisely what that lieutenant would or should have done if we had
      given him time. And when you row toward that submarine, row like the
      devil, because that's the way the bombing party would row in their hurry
      to board the submarine and steam clear of the explosion. It is my guess
      that the instant you heave alongside you will be snagged with boat hooks
      by the men on her deck. In the excitement of making a quick get-away
      nobody will be looking into your faces, anyhow; they'll see your familiar
      dungaree suits and caps; some of them may even give you a hand to help you
      when you leap aboard. Do not despise such help; just extend your left
      hands and before you let go the enemy's right bend your guns&mdash;and
      you, Terry, your monkey wrench&mdash;over their heads. You'll have the
      deck in a pig's whisper! Then, Mike, the rest is up to you. I've made the
      ball; now you fire it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it the submarine will be in such a hurry to get away that all the
      men on her deck will reach down and snake the boat in; once out of danger,
      they'll plan on knocking that collapsible down and storing it away at
      their leisure. Tackle 'em while they're busy with the boat&mdash;provided
      you get aboard unsuspected. Terence, remember to shout the minute you go
      into action&mdash;and I'll give you fighting light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following these instructions, Cappy had very solemnly shaken hands all
      round and departed for the bridge, where he removed the canvas covering
      from the searchlight, bent the reflector toward the submarine, and waited,
      with his nervous old finger on the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of Cappy Ricks' instructions, Mike Murphy and Terence Reardon
      rowed furiously toward the submarine&mdash;so furiously, indeed, that the
      harsh grating of their oars in the rowlocks apprised Captain Emil Bechtel
      of their approach some seconds before the boat was visible. At his brisk
      command the men on deck stepped down to the low pipe railing on the port
      side of the deck, prepared to snag the boat the instant she drew
      alongside. When he could hear the sound of the commander's voice, Mike
      Murphy chanced a quick look over his shoulder, noted the position of the
      submarine, and turned his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four more strokes, Terry; then ship your oars,&rdquo; he cautioned the engineer
      in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the fourth stroke Terence obediently shipped his oars; with a deft
      twist of one oar, Murphy straightened the boat and shot neatly in
      alongside the submarine, the deck of which was less than three feet above
      the water. As Cappy Ricks had anticipated, the men on that deck promptly
      snagged the boat at bow and stern with boat hooks&mdash;and on the instant
      Cappy Ricks' bully boys leaped for their prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it, Terence P. Reardon was the only one offered a
      helping hand&mdash;and he did not despise it; neither did he forget
      Cappy's last instructions. With neatness and ample force he brought his
      monkey wrench down on the German's skull; and then to Cappy Ricks, waiting
      on the bridge of the <i>Narcissus</i>, came the ancient Irish battlecry of
      <i>Faugh-a-ballagh!</i> For the benefit of those not versed in the ways of
      the fighting Celt, be it known that <i>Faugh-a-ballagh</i> means Clear the
      Road. And history records but few instances when Irish soldiery have
      raised that cry and rushed without clearing a pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight was too short and savage for description. Suffice it to say that
      not a shot was fired&mdash;the work was too close for that, for the
      surprise had been complete. Even before Cappy Ricks could focus the
      steamer's searchlight on the fracas, it was over. Terence P. Reardon got
      two in two strokes of his trusty monkey wrench; Sam Daniels and his two
      fellow-bronco-busters each laid open a German scalp with the long barrels
      of their forty-fives; and Michael J. Murphy, plain lunatic-crazy with
      rage, disdaining all but Nature's weapons, tied into the amazed Captain
      Emil Bechtel under the rules of the Longshoremen's Union&mdash;which is to
      state that Michael J. Murphy clinched Emil Bechtel, lifted him, set him
      down hard on his plump back, crawled him, knelt on his arms, and addressed
      him in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! (A right jab to the face.) You would, would you? (Left jab to face.)
      You pig-iron polisher! (Bending the nose back forcibly with the heel of
      his fist.) When I get (smash) through with your (smash) head (smash) it'll
      be long (smash) before you'll block (smash) your hat again (smash) on the
      Samson post, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out av me way, Michael, lad, till I get a kick at his slats!&rdquo; crooned
      Terence P. Reardon, heaving alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gossoon! Take care of the scuttle; don't let them close it down, or
      they'll submerge and drown us. Leave this lad to me, I tell you. He's the
      captain, and why shouldn't he be killed by one of his own rank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus rebuked, Terence curbed his blood-thirsty proclivities. Leaving his
      countryman to beat his devil's tattoo on the submarine commander, Terence
      leaped to the open scuttle just in time to bang another head as it
      appeared on a level with the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that be a lesson to you!&rdquo; he called as the unconscious man slid back
      down the companion into the interior of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat on the lid of the scuttle, poised his monkey wrench on high
      over the scuttle, and awaited developments, the while he tossed an order
      over his shoulder to Sam Daniels:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me the bum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; Mr. Daniels queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The German bum, av coorse,&rdquo; Terence retorted waspishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all these bums are Germans&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that kind av a bum!&rdquo; howled Terence. &ldquo;I mean the bum in the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus enlightened, Sam brought a bomb from the boat and handed it to the
      engineer. In the interim Mike Murphy had polished off his man to his
      entire satisfaction and joined Terence at the scuttle, while one of the
      horse wranglers, a cool individual and a firm believer in safety first,
      collected the weapons from the fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy approached the scuttle and bawled down it to the amazed and
      puzzled crew below. As a linguist Mike was no great shakes, particularly
      when called upon to juggle German; but he was a resolute fellow and not
      afraid to do his best at all times. Consequently his hail took the form of
      &ldquo;Hey! <i>Landsmann!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something told Terence Reardon that Michael was through; so he added his
      mite to the store and bellowed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Spreckels die deutsch,</i> ye blackguards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then both sat back to await developments. Presently a voice at the foot of
      the companion said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello dere! Vat iss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vat iss? Hell iss! Dot's vat! Listen to me, you Dutchy. I'm the skipper
      of that horse transport your commander tried to sink without warning, and
      I'm in command of the deck of this craft, with the scuttle open; and you
      can't submerge and wash me off, either. When I give the word I want you
      and your men to come up, one at a time and no crowding. And if you're not
      up five minutes after I order you up I'll not wait; I'll set a bomb in
      your turret, back off in the small boat and kill with revolvers any man
      that tries to come up and see where the fuse is burning in order to put it
      out. Do you surrender, or would you rather die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vait a minute und I find oud,&rdquo; the German answered promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required five minutes for a council of war below decks; then the
      interpreter came to the foot of the companion and informed Mike Murphy
      that, considering the circumstances, they had decided to live. In the
      interim the skipper of the <i>Narcissus</i> had arrived, with
      re-enforcements, in the cruiser, and reported that his crew was getting
      back aboard the steamer as fast as possible and would have her under
      command again in a minute. At Murphy's order the unconscious Germans were
      put aboard the cruiser; later, when the remainder of the submersible's
      crew came up, one at a time, they were disarmed and lined up on the little
      deck; whereupon Michael J. Murphy addressed their spokesman thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen&mdash;you! It would be just like you to have set a time bomb
      somewhere in this submarine to blow her up after you were all safely out
      of her. If you did you made a grave tactical error. You're not going to
      leave her for quite a while yet. You're going to sit quietly here on deck,
      under guard, while the steamer hooks on to this submarine and tows her;
      and if my prize crew is blown up, remember, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spokesman&mdash;he was the chief engineer, by the way&mdash;yelled &ldquo;<i>Ach,
      Gott!</i>&rdquo; and leaped for the scuttle. Mike Murphy followed him into the
      engine room in time to see him stamp out a long length of slow-burning
      fuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; Murphy queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot von vas sufficient, if it goes off,&rdquo; the German answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Mike Murphy replied. &ldquo;I'll take a chance and so will you.
      You'll stay aboard and run those oil engines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later with the submarine's crew safely under lock and key on
      the <i>Narcissus,</i> the big freighter continued on her course, followed
      by the captured submarine, with Michael J. Murphy in her turret and a
      quartermaster from the <i>Narcissus</i> at her helm. In the engine room
      her own engineer grudgingly explained to Terence P. Reardon the workings
      of an oil engine and the ramifications of the electric-light system&mdash;and
      during all of that period the deadly monkey wrench never left the port
      engineer's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Daniels and his comrades were once more back aboard the <i>Narcissus,</i>
      attending to the horses; and Cappy Ricks, his heart so filled with pride
      that it was like to burst, occupied the submarine's turret with the
      doughty Michael J. For an hour they discussed the marvelous coup until
      there was no angle of it left undiscussed; whereupon fell a silence, with
      Michael J.'s eyes fixed on the dark bulk ahead that marked the <i>Narcissus</i>,
      and Cappy's thoughts on what Matt Peasley and Mr. Skinner would say when
      they heard the glorious news.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly an hour not a word passed between the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Cappy's regular breathing drew Murphy's attention to him. He had
      fallen asleep in his seat, his chin bent on his old breast, a little
      half-smile on his lips. And as Murphy looked at him pridefully Cappy spoke
      in his sleep:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy sailor! How Mike Murphy can swear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terence P. Reardon came to the foot of the little spiral staircase leading
      to the turret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michael, me lad,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;the internal-combustion ile ingin' is
      the marine ingin' av the future. They're as simple as two an' two is four.
      Listen, <i>avic!</i> Does she not run like a twenty-four-jewel watch? An'
      this man that invinted thim was a Ger-r-man&mdash;more power to him!
      Faith, I'm thinkin' if the Ger-r-mans were as great in war as they are in
      peace 'twould need more nor the Irish to take the measure av thim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irish?&rdquo; Mike Murphy answered irritably. &ldquo;Terence, quit your bragging! God
      knows the Irish are great&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest in the wide, wide wur-rld!&rdquo; Terence declared, with all the
      egotism of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whist, Terry! There's a little old Yankee man aboard; if you wake him up
      he'll call you a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darlin' ould fox!&rdquo; Terry murmured affectionately, and went back to
      his engines.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The entire office force of the Blue Star Navigation Company and the Ricks
      Lumber &amp; Logging Company had assembled in the general office to greet
      Cappy Ricks, Mike Murphy and Terence Reardon upon their return from
      Europe, and to hear at first hand the story of their wanderings and
      adventures. And when the wondrous tale had been told, and business was
      once more resumed, Matt Peasley, Mr. Skinner, Mike and Terence convened in
      Cappy Ricks' office for further discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sent that half million dollars to New York to be transferred to the
      credit of the French Government when the bill of sale for that steamer
      should be deposited with the bank there,&rdquo; Matt remarked presently. &ldquo;What
      kind of a vessel did you buy, Cappy? What are her dimensions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a ship did I buy?&rdquo; Cappy piped. &ldquo;Hum-m-m! A ship is good. I
      bought four; and&mdash;believe me!&mdash;they're no skiffs, either. All of
      them are big foreign-going steel tramps, with lots of speed and power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four for half a million dollars?&rdquo; Matt Peasley cried unbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would have cost anybody else a million and a half; but&mdash;er&mdash;well,
      you see, Matt, I had a stand-in with the right people. The four vessels I
      bought were all prizes of war&mdash;German merchantmen converted into
      commerce raiders, which had slipped through the cordon of British cruisers
      and got into the North Atlantic, where French cruisers overhauled them and
      brought them into port. They were all there and up for sale to the highest
      bidder when we got there with the horses and our captured submarine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid half a million for the lot, which is probably about half of what it
      cost to build them; and there was a Frenchman and an Englishman bidding
      against me. They each had me topped, and the vessels were knocked down to
      the Frenchman; but when he found I was a competitor&mdash;that I was
      Monsieur le Capitaine Ricks&mdash;that's what they called me, Matt&mdash;in
      command of the party that captured a German submarine, intact and without
      the loss of a single man on either side-say, Matt, the stuff was all off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and the Englishman went into a conference; and the result was, the
      Frenchman ran out on his bid and forfeited his ten-per-cent certified
      check. That left the Englishman the next highest bidder; and he ran out on
      his bid and left the ships to me! Then the Englishman shook hands with me
      and the Frenchman kissed me. I thought the least I could do was to make
      good to them on the earnest money they had forfeited, and they accepted
      it. Then the President of France heard about it and came down to Brest to
      see me; and he kissed me, too, and gave me the Officers' Cross of the
      Legion of Honor. I didn't tell him I was just a private in the ranks. Oh,
      no! Nothing doing. I was introduced as Monsieur le Capitaine Ricks&mdash;and
      that settled it. I was an officer, for all my courtesy title; and I took
      the Cross, because I was prouder than Punch to have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Chamber of Deputies met and voted the Frenchman and the
      Englishman back their forfeited earnest money; and they gave me back my
      checks, and I wrote new ones for the same amount and split the swag
      fifty-fifty between the two nations for the care of their wounded. Then I
      gave a dinner aboard the submarine, and President Poincare was present. I
      presented the submarine, with the compliments of the Blue Star Navigation
      Company, to the Republic of France, and the President accepted, all hands
      went out on deck and we cracked a bottle of champagne over that
      submersible's bows and rechristened her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo; Matt and Skinner chorused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Shamrock&mdash;out of compliment to Mike and Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Matt cried. &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Matt. Our business was finished and I was anxious to get back on
      the job; so we engaged skippers and crews to bring our four freighters to
      New York, and came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better step lively, boy, and dig up some business for them! Mike will
      give you the data on their tonnage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt drew Mike Murphy aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mike,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;did the old man get soused at that dinner
      aboard the <i>Shamrock?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Matt,&rdquo; Murphy answered; &ldquo;what Monsieur le Capitaine Ricks does
      outside of office hours is none of my business&mdash;or yours, either. And
      if you don't like that answer help yourself to a new port captain. I'm not
      telling everything I know, Matt.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning of April 3, 1917, Cappy Ricks came down to his office,
      spread a newspaper on his desk and carefully cut from it the war address
      of President Wilson to Congress, made the night before. This clipping the
      old gentleman folded carefully; he placed it in an envelope, sealed it and
      wrote across the face of the envelope: &ldquo;Property of Alden Matthew
      Peasley.&rdquo; Then he summoned Mr. Skinner, president of the Ricks Lumber
      &amp; Logging Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;have you read the President's Message
      to Congress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that President of ours isn't some tabasco, eh? By the Holy
      Pink-Toed Prophet, he's just naturally read Bill Hohenzollern out of the
      party. Bully for Woodrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner's calm cold features refused to thaw, however, under the heat
      of his employer's enthusiasm, seeing which Cappy slid out to the edge of
      his chair and gazed contemplatively at Skinner over the rims of his
      spectacles. &ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo; he said. The very tempo of that throat-clearing
      should have warned Mr. Skinner that he was treading on thin ice, but with
      his usual complacence he ignored the storm signal, for his mind was upon
      private, not public affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm offered the old barkentine <i>C. D. Bryant</i> for a cargo of redwood
      to Sydney,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;The freight rate is two hundred and twenty
      shillings per thousand feet, but the <i>Bryant</i> is so old and rotten I
      can't get any insurance on the cargo if I ship by her. I'm just wondering
      if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haramph-h-h! Ahem-m-m!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;it's worth while taking a chance to move that foreign order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner!&rdquo; Cappy almost shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner looked at him, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you think and talk of old barkentines and non-insurable foreign
      cargoes at this crisis in our country's history?&rdquo; the autocrat of the
      numerous Ricks corporations shrilled furiously. &ldquo;Dad burn your picture,
      Skinner, are you human? Don't you ever get a thrill from reading a
      document like this?&rdquo;&mdash;and he tapped the envelope containing the press
      clipping. &ldquo;What kind of juice runs in your arteries, anyhow? Red blood or
      buttermilk? Is your soul so dog-goned dead, crushed under the weight of
      dollars, that you have failed to realize this document is destined to go
      down in history side by side with Lincoln's Gettysburg speech? I'll bet
      you don't know the Gettysburg speech. Bet you never heard of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; Skinner retorted suavely. &ldquo;Pray do not excite
      yourself. Suppose war does impend? Is that any reason why I should neglect
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is, you gibbering jackdaw! I feel like setting fire to the
      building, just to celebrate. Can't you step into my office on a day like
      this and discuss the country and her affairs for five minutes, just to
      prove you're an American citizen? Can't you rejoice with me over these
      lofty, noble sentiments&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words, words, empty words,&rdquo; warned Mr. Skinner, always a reactionary
      Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner,&rdquo; said Cappy with deadly calm, &ldquo;one more disloyal peep out of you
      and I shall have no alternative save to request your resignation. I think
      you're a pacifist at heart, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; snorted Skinner. &ldquo;You've changed your tune, haven't you? Who
      trotted up and down California Street last fall, soliciting campaign
      contributions for the Republican nominee from the lumber and shipping
      interests? Wasn't it Alden P. Ricks? Who thought the country was going to
      wrack and ruin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was last fall,&rdquo; Cappy interrupted shrilly. &ldquo;We live and learn&mdash;that
      is, some of us do,&rdquo; he added significantly. &ldquo;Never mind about my politics
      last fall; just remember I haven't any this spring. I'm an American
      citizen, and by the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, some German or Germans will
      find it out before I'm gathered to the bosom of Abraham. I have a right to
      disapprove of my President if I feel like it, but I'll be shot if I'll let
      anybody else pick on him.&rdquo; And Cappy shook his head emphatically several
      times like a squinch-owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm for him, now that we're committed to this war,&rdquo; Skinner declared
      in an effort to soothe the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! We're locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen. If
      we'd been for him when the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk instead of being
      divided in our opinions and swayed in our judgment by a lot of hysterical
      pacifists and German propagandists we'd have been into the war long ago
      and saved millions of human lives; we'd have had the war won.&rdquo; He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a prime lot of jackasses we Americans are!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We talk
      of liberty and demand license; we prate of democracy and we're a nation of
      snobs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me about something,&rdquo; Skinner reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; I was forgetting. This envelope, Skinner, contains the
      President's address. Take it and put it in the vault, and when my grandson
      is twelve years old give that press clipping to his mother and tell her I
      said she was to read it to the boy and make him learn it by heart. I won't
      be on hand to do the Americanizing of that youngster myself, and most
      likely Matt Peasley will be too busy to think much about it, so I'm taking
      no chances. You rile me to beat the band sometimes, Skinner, but I'll say
      this much in your favor: I have never known you to forget anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner took the envelope and departed, and Cappy rang for a
      stenographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a telegram, fast day message,&rdquo; he barked: &ldquo;'His Excellency, The
      President, White House, Washington, D. C. Dear Mister President: I did not
      vote for you last fall, but your address of last night makes me ashamed
      that I did not. I am controlling owner of the Blue Star Navigation
      Company, operating a fleet of fifty vessels of various kinds, twelve of
      which are foreign-going steam freighters. Am also controlling owner of the
      Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company, cutting a million feet of lumber
      daily. Everything I control, every dollar I possess, is at the service of
      my country. God bless you, sir! Alden P. Ricks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds sloppy, but it's the way I feel,&rdquo; Cappy declared. &ldquo;When a man
      has a big heart-breaking job to do and a lot of Philistines are knocking
      him, maybe it helps him to retain his faith in humankind to have some
      fellow grow sincerely sloppy and slip a telegraphic cheer in with the
      hoots. Besides, if I didn't let off steam today I'd swell up and bust
      myself all over the office&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Mr. Terence P. Reardon, port engineer of the Blue Star
      Navigation Company, entered. Mr. Reardon's right eye was in deep mourning
      and at no very remote period something&mdash;presumably a fist&mdash;had
      shifted his nose slightly to starboard; indeed, even as he entered Cappy's
      office a globule of the rich red Reardon blood trembled in each of the
      port engineer's nostrils. His knuckles were slightly skinned and the light
      of battle blazed in his black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terence, my dear, dear fellow,&rdquo; murmured the horrified Cappy, &ldquo;you look
      as if you had been fed into a concrete mixer. Have you been fighting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sor,&rdquo; Mr. Reardon replied in his deep Kerry brogue, &ldquo;ye might call
      it that for lack of somethin' more expressive. I've just fired the chief
      engineer o' the <i>Tillicum.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Denicke? Why, Terry, he's a first-rate engineer. I'm amazed. He was
      with us ten years before you entered the employ&mdash;worked up from
      oiler; in fact, I must have an explanation of your action in this case,
      Terence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called the President a nut. I fired him for that. Then he said the
      Kaiser was the greatest single force for civilization that ever was, an'
      wit' that I gave him a lift under the lug an' we wint at it. He's in the
      Harbor Receivin' Hospital this minute, an' I'm here to tell ye, sor, wit'
      all respect, that if ye don't like the way I've treated that Dutchman ye
      can get yerself a new port ingineer, for I'll quit, an' that's somethin'
      I'm not wishful to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite calmly Cappy Ricks pressed the buzzer on his desk. The cashier of
      the Blue Star Navigation Company entered. &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said Cappy, &ldquo;hereafter,
      when making out Mr. Reardon's pay check, tack onto it twenty-five dollars
      extra each month. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sor,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Reardon, quite overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried Cappy. &ldquo;You're a vision of sudden death. Go wash
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Reardon took his departure Cappy sighed. &ldquo;If Skinner only had a set
      of works like that port engineer!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If he only had!&rdquo;

    <p>
      It will be recalled that war with Germany was declared on Good Friday.
      Bright and early on Saturday morning Cappy Ricks arrived at his office and
      immediately summoned Mr. Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, my dear boy,&rdquo; he chirped, &ldquo;'the tumult and the shouting dies.
      We're down to brass tacks&mdash;at last; and now is time for all good men
      and true to come to the aid of the party. I'm too old to bear arms, and
      when I was young enough bantam battalions weren't fashionable;
      nevertheless, I am enlisting for the war, and I start in this morning to
      do my part. I won't wear any uniform, but believe me, Skinner, I'm the
      little corporal who's going to mobilize the Blue Star Navigation Company
      and the Ricks Lumber &amp; Logging Company, together with all and sundry
      of their subsidiary corporations. I'm starting with you, Skinner. Are you
      figuring on enlisting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir. I'm forty-three years old, married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No excuses necessary, Skinner. Even if you had planned to enlist I would
      have forbidden the banns. You'd make a bird of a paymaster or
      quartermaster, but as an enlisted man&mdash;well, the other bad soldier
      boys would toss you in a blanket. So I'll assign you to a job in civil
      life. Skinner, what do you know about aeroplanes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely nothing, except that they fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then learn something! Skinner, the ideal wood for aeroplane construction
      is clear Pacific Coast spruce. I've been reading up on the subject.
      Inasmuch as this war must be won in the air, you can imagine the number of
      aeroplanes the country must turn out in the next eighteen months.
      Stu-pen-dous, Skinner, simply stu-pen-dous! Try to visualize the wastage
      alone in the aeroplanes on the battle fronts; consider the thousands of
      seaplanes that will scour the Atlantic on the lookout for submarines, and
      then ask yourself, Skinner, what the devil those overworked army and navy
      officers in Washington are going to do about laying in a supply of clear
      Pacific Coast spruce before these pirates of lumbermen get next and boost
      the price clear out of sight. Skinner, what is clear spruce worth at the
      Northern mills today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About fifty-five dollars per thousand, sir. For years clear spruce never
      rose in price beyond thirty-five dollars, but purchases by the British
      Government have shot the price up during the past year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! And purchases by the United States Government will shoot the
      price up to a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand if you and I don't get
      busy. Now then, Skinner, listen to me! We have a couple of thousand acres
      of wonderful spruce timber adjacent to our fir holdings at Port Hadlock,
      Washington. Wire the mill manager to swamp in a logging railroad to that
      spruce timber, put in logging camps and concentrate on spruce. The clear
      stock we'll sell to the Government, and the lower grades will be snapped
      up by the box factories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Skinner nodded his comprehension of the order and Cappy continued:
      &ldquo;Wire our mill managers at Astoria, Oregon and Eureka, California, to log
      out all the spruce they come across among the fir. As for you, Skinner,
      accept no more orders for clear spruce from our regular customers, and go
      easy on accepting orders for any kind of lumber from our Eastern
      customers. All those car shipments must be made up of kiln-dried stock,
      and we'll want most of the space in our dry kilns to cook this clear green
      spruce for Uncle Sam, because he's going to want it in a hurry, and if he
      can't get it when he wants it&mdash;why, chaos has come again and all
      hell's let loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What price do you propose charging the Government for this clear spruce?&rdquo;
       the cautious Skinner queried. He owned a little stock in the Ricks Lumber
      &amp; Logging Company and already he had a vision of an extra dividend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolute cost plus ten per cent,&rdquo; replied Cappy promptly. &ldquo;No excess
      profits at the expense of the country at war, Skinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed upon Skinner contemplatively for several seconds. &ldquo;And mind you
      don't figure the cost too liberally,&rdquo; he warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a jugful! You scatter round the market and buy up every stick of
      clear two-inch spruce sawed and on hand at the Northern mills. Buy at the
      market, but do not hesitate to go five dollars over the market if
      necessary to get the stock. Then place orders for all the clear spruce the
      mills can cut and deliver within the next six months, and we'll have the
      market hog tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to do it, Skinner. I tell you there isn't a whole lot of difference
      between a lumberman and a manufacturer or a food speculator. When he gets
      the public foul, doesn't the public pay through the nose? Haven't we been
      doing it ourselves in the matter of ship freights? But we must reform,
      Skinner, we must reform and get down to a cooperative basis, no matter how
      great the agony. On this spruce deal alone, for instance, we'll save the
      Government a couple of million dollars. See if we don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're entitled to a liberal profit,&rdquo; Mr. Skinner protested. &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ifs, buts or ands! Obey orders! About the time we have the market on
      clear spruce well cornered the lumbermen's boys will be in the army and
      the lumbermen themselves will have begun to realize that they must
      sacrifice something for their country. And once we're sane we'll be able
      to work hand in glove with the Government. The United States of America
      has been money-mad for a long time, Skinner, but this war is going to
      spiritualize us and show us that there's a lot more in life than
      dollar-chasing. Hop to your job, P. D. Q., Skinner, my boy; and as you
      pass out send Captain Matt Peasley in to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt Peasley came smilingly into his father-in-law's office. &ldquo;Well,
      Cappy,&rdquo; he hailed the old gentleman, &ldquo;I understand you've come out of your
      retirement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're damned whistling, I have!&rdquo; Cappy rejoined. &ldquo;Something doing, boy,
      something for everybody! Have they told you about it in the general
      office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told me about what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the President asking me if I would cooperate with him to the extent
      of serving as the Pacific Coast member of the Shipping Board? I guess that
      isn't some honor, eh? How the devil he ever dug up an old fossil like me
      is a mystery. I wired him, advising that he appoint a younger man, but he
      replied that he knew I was the livest shipping man in the country and an
      American through and through. So, of course, Matt, I have accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your forty odd years' experience will be of inestimable value to the
      country in this emergency,&rdquo; Matt declared heartily. &ldquo;I'm proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, son. Now then, Matt, to business! The Government's going to
      need every one of our ships that can run foreign.&rdquo; Matt nodded. &ldquo;Very
      well, then,&rdquo; Cappy continued; &ldquo;as fast as their present charters lapse,
      decline to recharter except for single trips. We must go on a war basis
      and be prepared to turn our ships over to the Government on short notice.
      I'll be too busy to keep my eye on the details of the Blue Star's
      transactions with the Government, so I'll give you a straight tip now&mdash;I
      want no gouging. Remember that, Matthew, my son.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day Cappy had a call from Sam Daniels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Sam,&rdquo; Cappy greeted his lanky ranch manager. &ldquo;What brings you up
      to town? Not that I'm not glad to see you, for I was on the point of
      writing you on some matters that had occurred to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come up to resign my job,&rdquo; Daniels declared humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resign the best job you've ever had, Sam!&rdquo; Cappy was amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To resign the best job I ever will have, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Daniels hitched his chair close to his employer's desk. &ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I'm awful sorry, but I'm goin' soldiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks sprang to his feet with an oath. &ldquo;You're not!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I
      won't hear of it. You're too valuable a man to go into the army and get
      yourself killed&mdash;particularly since you can do your share at home.
      Why, I was just going to write you and give you your orders for patriotic
      duty. You go back to the ranch, Sam, and get busy. Plant spuds, wheat,
      oats, barley, corn&mdash;plant all you can of it. Raise heifers, sheep,
      hogs, cows, bulls, calves, turkeys&mdash;everything that can be eaten.
      Raise horses&mdash;and in particular, raise mules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather raise hell with a bunch of Germans,&rdquo; Sam Daniels declared
      feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your job is to help produce cereals and canned beef for the
      hell-raisers,&rdquo; Cappy declared. &ldquo;The army will want horses for the
      artillery and mules for the transport. Why, this war may last for years.
      Sam, you infernal scoundrel, you get back on the farm. You're forty-five
      years old and you've been shot and whittled enough in your day to last you
      the remainder of your natural life. Let the young fellows do the fighting
      abroad, while you and I and the other hasbeens do it at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd a heap rather lay off in the brush somewheres an' snipe Germans,&rdquo; Mr.
      Daniels pleaded. &ldquo;On the level, boss, if they'll give me a Springfield
      rifle with telescopic sights I'll guarantee to sicken anythin' I get a
      fair sight on at a thousand yards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In-fer-nal scoundrel! How dare you argue with me! You get back on your
      job!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, I'm going into the army,&rdquo; Daniels announced sadly, but nevertheless
      firmly. &ldquo;I'm givin' you a month's notice so you can get a man to take my
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy surrendered. &ldquo;All right, Sam. If you survive, your job will be
      waiting for you when you get back. However, you needn't give me any
      notice. I'll have another man in charge of the ranch to-morrow, and you
      can enlist today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're not sore at me, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, I'm proud of you. Wish I were young enough to go it with you. Are
      you in a hurry to get to France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then join the marines. They always go first. Good-bye, Sam. Good luck to
      you and God bless you! Draw your wages as you go out and tell the cashier
      I said to give you an extra month's wages for tobacco money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Daniels withdrew, visibly filled with emotion. Ten minutes later Cappy
      Ricks, watching at his office window, saw Mr. Daniels cross the street and
      enter the marines' recruiting office. Immediately Cappy called that
      recruiting office on the telephone and asked for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, doctor!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In a few minutes a lanky, battle scarred
      rancher is coming in to be examined. I don't want him to enlist. He's my
      ranch manager and worth more to the country in his job than at the Front.
      You turn him down physically, doctor, and I'll guarantee to send you five
      fine recruits instead of that old fossil. His name is Sam Daniels, and I'm
      Alden P. Ricks, of the Blue Star Navigation Company, across the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need an automobile to send our recruiting sergeant out through the
      state,&rdquo; the wary medico replied. &ldquo;Now, if you could loan us one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have my own car and chauffeur over in half an hour, and you keep him
      as long as you need him,&rdquo; Cappy piped. &ldquo;Only tell Sam Daniels he's
      faltering on the brink of the grave and send him back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Mr. Daniels slouched into Cappy Ricks' office. &ldquo;Well,
      Private Daniels,&rdquo; the old man saluted him, &ldquo;you look downcast. Has
      something slipped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it has. The doc over to the recruitin' office says I got a
      heart murmur from smoking cigarettes, which it's a cinch the excitement o'
      battle brings on death from heart failure, an' then folks would say I died
      o' fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's crazy Sam! Tell him to go chase himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he's right, Mr. Ricks. He 'most cried to let me go, an' was for
      waivin' the heart murmur, but it seems I got a floatin' kidney, an' flat
      feet. Gosh, I never knew I had flat feet, but then I've rid horses all my
      life an' ain't never hiked none to speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent several minutes, studying the pattern of the office carpet.
      Presently he looked up. &ldquo;Is my successor at the ranch already appointed?&rdquo;
       he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to the fields and the kind-faced cows, Samuel,&rdquo; quoth Cappy
      gently. &ldquo;Hurry, or you'll miss the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam Daniels fled, and hard on his heels came Mrs. Michael J. Murphy, <i>nee</i>
      Miss Keenan. It will be recalled that prior to her happy alliance with
      Michael J. Murphy, Mrs. Murphy had been Cappy Ricks' favorite
      stenographer. He received her cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, what's gone wrong, my dear?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Have you and Mike
      been making a hash of your married life that you should come in here on
      the verge of tears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Murphy blinked away a tear or two and sat down. &ldquo;Some of the boys in
      the office will be enlisting, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I wonder if there
      might be a vacancy for me&mdash;if I might not have my old position back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks was genuinely concerned. &ldquo;Why, Mike won't let you earn your
      living,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Why do you make such an extraordinary request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Mike's sake, Mr. Ricks. Of late he has been very nervous and
      distrait; scarcely touches his meals, and thinks, talks and dreams of war.
      Last night he dreamed he was back in the navy and shouted out an order
      that woke him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, I believe Mike did spend several years in the navy
      prior to going into mercantile marine,&rdquo; Cappy observed. &ldquo;So he has the war
      fever again, eh? Wants to go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since he received a letter from the Navy League. They're searching
      out all the old navy men&mdash;gun pointers particularly&mdash;and asking
      them to come back to help train the young fellows just coming into the
      service. Mike was a gun pointer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what in thunder is he hesitating for?&rdquo; Cappy piped wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me. Mike's married to me, you know, and he worries about what will
      happen to me if he should be killed. He knows I'll be broken-hearted if he
      enlists&mdash;he's afraid I'll not let him go. But if I got my job back
      and was self-supporting, Mike's conscience would be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want him to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Ricks, but he must go. I do not want to make a coward or a
      slacker out of Mike. I've got to do my part, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Cappy feelingly, &ldquo;you're a noble woman. Go back and attend
      to your little home; Mike may go whenever he's ready and his salary with
      the Blue Star will go on while he is in the navy; his job will be waiting
      for him when he comes back. Good old Mike! How dreadful a crime to hobble
      that Irishman with a first-class fight in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Mike had left the office Cappy stiffened out suddenly in his
      chair, clenched his fists and closed his eyes, as if in pain. And
      presently between the wrinkled old lids two tears crept forth. Poor Cappy!
      He was finding it very, very hard to be old and little and out of the
      fight, for in every war in which the United States had engaged
      representatives of the tribe of Ricks had gladly offered their bodies for
      the supreme sacrifice, and as Cappy's active mind ran down the long and
      bloody list his heart swelled with anguish in the knowledge that he was
      doomed to play an inglorious part in the war with Germany. Mr. Skinner
      coming in with a letter to Cappy, observed the old man's emotion and asked
      him if he was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Skinner, I am,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I'm sick at heart. God has given me
      everything I ever wanted except six big strapping sons. Just think,
      Skinner, what a glorious honor would be mine if I had six fine boys to
      give to my country.&rdquo; His old lips trembled. &ldquo;And you could bank on the
      Ricks boys,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;My boys would never wait to be drafted. No,
      sir-ree! When they heard the call they'd answer, like their ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, what has come over our boys of this generation? Why don't they
      volunteer? Why does the President have to beg for men? Has the soul of the
      idealist been corroded by a life of ease? Did the spirit of adventure die
      with our forefathers? Is it any harder to die just because war has become
      more terrible&mdash;more deadly? Oh, Skinner, Skinner! To be young and
      tall and strong and whirled in the cycle of vast events&mdash;to play a
      man's part in a glorious undertaking&mdash;to feel that I have enriched
      the world with my efforts, however humble, or with my body revitalized the
      soil made fallow by a ravishing monster. I feel, Skinner&mdash;I feel so
      much and can do so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he did do something that very afternoon. One after the other
      he examined all the young men in his employ, discovered which of them
      could afford the luxury of enlisting and then asked them bluntly whether
      they were going to enlist. Three of them said they were, and Cappy
      promised each of them a month's salary the day he should report to him in
      uniform. Nine others appeared to be uncertain of their duty, so Cappy
      fired them all, to the great distress of Mr. Skinner and Matt Peasley.
      Cappy, however, turned a deaf ear to their remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who won't fight for his country is no good,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and I
      won't keep a no-good son of a slacker on my pay roll. Get married men or
      men who have been rejected for military service to take the places of
      these bums who haven't courage enough even to try to enlist.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The campaign for the Liberty bonds brought Cappy an appointment from the
      mayor as captain of a corps of volunteer bond salesmen to work the
      wholesale lumber and shipping trade, and for three weeks the old gentleman
      was as busy as the proverbial one-armed paper hanger with the itch. He was
      obsessed with a fear that the bond issue would be under-subscribed by
      about a billion and a half and result in the United States of America
      being accorded a hearty Teutonic horse laugh. Consequently he made five
      separate subscriptions on his own account, and just before the lists
      closed on the last day he was again overcome with apprehension and
      subscribed for an additional ten thousand dollars' worth for his grandson!
      When the result of the Liberty-bond campaign was made known he almost wept
      with joy and gave a wonderful dinner to his corps of salesmen, after which
      he went down to his ranch to rest for a week and see what Sam Daniels was
      up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning he returned to town, prepared to leap, heart and soul into the
      hundred-million-dollar Red Cross drive, he had a visit from his port
      captain, Michael J. Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; Murphy announced, &ldquo;I've cleaned up all the little details in
      my department, your new port captain is on the job, and I'm about to go
      over to the naval training station on Goat Island and hold up my hand
      again. But before I go, sir, I want to express to you something of what I
      feel for what you've done for me and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut. Not another peep out of you, sir!&rdquo; Cappy commanded. To be
      thanked for anything always made him feel uncomfortable. &ldquo;What branch of
      the service do you hope to get into, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get aboard a destroyer, sir, though they're the divil an' all
      to live aboard. They offer the best chance for action. Patrolling the
      submarine zone, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; Cappy groaned; &ldquo;everybody's got the submarines on the brain, and
      I'm tagging along with the rest. Mike, I swear I can't sleep nights,
      thinking of this war. It breaks my heart to realize I'm out of it. And
      because I'm a shipping man, naturally my fool brain runs to submarines and
      how to control them. Mike, I have a great yearning to sink a submarine;
      the screams of those scoundrels aboard her would be music to my ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a serious problem,&rdquo; Murphy declared soberly; &ldquo;but I'm hoping our
      Yankee ingenuity will solve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we haven't done it to date, and in the meantime all the nut
      inventors in the world are sending their nut ideas in to the National
      Council of Defense. Of course I have a bright idea too. I'm a great hand
      at hatching cute schemes, you know. However, I differ from the average
      submarine nut in this&mdash;that I want to try out my theory in practice
      before submitting it to an expectant world. Still, I'd need you to help
      me; and now that you're going into the navy I suppose I'll have to forget
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to remember a scheme of yours that resulted in the capture of a
      submarine last year,&rdquo; Murphy reminded the old man. &ldquo;That was a bully
      scheme, and I'm willing to wager that the head which produced it can
      produce another just as good. Tell me your plan for eliminating
      submarines, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My scheme doesn't contemplate a continuous performance,&rdquo; Cappy hastened
      to explain, &ldquo;but it might work out once or twice&mdash;and in this great
      international emergency anything is worth trying once. I could demonstrate
      my theory in about two months&mdash;with your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; declared Michael J. Murphy, &ldquo;I'll wait until you give the
      demonstration before enlisting in the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you, Mike! I'll declare Terry Reardon in on the experiment
      also, for the reason that one of the ingredients required is a chief
      engineer with courage to spare. Now then, for my scheme: Do you know the
      <i>Costa Rica?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old steamer that used to run to Panama for the Pacific Mail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in the bone yard&mdash;laid up for keeps, Mike. Her plates are so
      thin and soft the least jar would punch a hole in her; she's wrecked and
      strained from fifty years of service; her engines are worn out, her
      boilers are burned out, her gear is antiquated, and even in these times of
      abnormal freight rates she's too far gone to patch up and keep running.
      They kicked her up in the mud of Oakland Inner Harbor yesterday, and there
      she'll be stripped of everything of value and left to rot. My plan, Mike,
      is to buy the old <i>Costa Rica</i> for a couple of thousand dollars, turn
      Terence Reardon and his gang loose on her engines and boilers for a couple
      of weeks and take the old coffin out for one final voyage. She can make
      eight or nine knots in good weather, and if she's torpedoed the loss will
      be trifling. Will you run the risk and take her out for me, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a decoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll put a hand-picked crew aboard her, Mike; we'll arm her fore and aft
      with six-inch guns, which we can readily get from the navy now that it's
      the fashion to arm merchantmen; and then go cruising in the submarine
      zone. You can pick up a few old navy men for a gun crew and train some of
      the Costa Rica's crew, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can get somebody to give me the range and manage to get the gun
      loaded somehow, I'll do the gun pointing; with half a chance I'll
      guarantee results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is exactly what I plan to give you&mdash;half a chance,&rdquo; Cappy
      declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;The Costa Rica isn't worth two hoots in a
      hollow, but she still looks enough like a steamer to attract submarines;
      and during this fine summer weather we can chance a final voyage with the
      old wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you get this 'we' stuff, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo; Mike Murphy queried
      bluntly. &ldquo;You're not figuring on going to sea in that coffin, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I most certainly am so figuring. I take my fun where I find it, Mike, and
      if I'm to plan and pay for this experiment&mdash;then, by gravy, I'm going
      to be on deck to watch it work out if it's the last act of my sinful
      career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they fire on us you may be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be firm' back at 'em, won't we? And if I'm killed in action, won't
      that be a fitting finish for a Ricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may be afloat in an open boat for a week. I don't want you to die of
      exposure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget it, Mike! I've been charged off to profit and loss for so many
      years it makes me ill to think of them. And you remember, my dear Mike,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>&ldquo;'To every man upon this earth
    Death cometh soon or late;
    And how can man die better
    Than facing fearful odds
    For the ashes of his fathers
    And the temples of his gods?''</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Don't argue with me, Mike. My mind is quite made up. I'm going into action
      in this war, for, as I said before, I'll try anything once&mdash;particularly
      when it isn't very expensive and I can afford the luxury. We're going to
      buy the <i>Costa Rica</i>, take her into the submarine zone and lose her,
      but, by the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet, we'll take a submarine with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if the German sees us first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy leaned forward and laid his index finger impressively on Michael J.
      Murphy's knee. &ldquo;That's the only way we can hope to win,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We
      must make certain the submarine sees us first. Mike, a German is a rabid
      disciple of law and order; anything out of the usual run of things upsets
      him terribly; he never makes allowance for the unexpected or for the other
      fellow's point of view. To be more exact, Mike, I figure that German
      psychology is the only kind of psychology a German can understand. And to
      tell you the truth, Mike,&rdquo; he added musingly, &ldquo;there are blamed few people
      who can understand mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy nodded a vigorous indorsement to this last remark, and
      Cappy went on: &ldquo;Do you think any proud and arrogant skipper of a German
      submarine would ever suspect an American citizen of such a harebrained
      scheme as the sending out of a rusty, creaking old rattletrap of a steamer
      that can't get out of her own way, for the avowed purpose of destroying
      him and his sub? No sir! His microphones will tell him, while he is still
      totally submerged, that his approaching prey is a slow poke and cannot
      possibly outrun him; then he'll come up, take a look and clinch his
      conclusions&mdash;after which he will attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you sir. He'll launch his torpedo and dive before I can get a
      shot at him or correct my range to hit him; then the torpedo will hit us
      and we'll go up like a shower of mush&mdash;probably with half a dozen men
      killed and nothing accomplished in the way of a return swat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the program a few months ago,&rdquo; Cappy retorted triumphantly.
      &ldquo;Have you noticed, however, that since merchantmen have been armed the
      submarines are more and more prone, when attacking in daylight, to pursue
      a steamer at a reasonable distance and rake her with shell fire? If a
      vessel is fired on and her skipper, looking back, notes the position of
      the submarine and realizes that he cannot possibly outrun her and that she
      outranges him, what does he do, Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does the sensible thing. Heaves to to avoid loss of life, gets his men
      into the boats and abandons his ship to the Hun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! And if the Hun thinks he is not likely to be disturbed for a
      couple of hours, what does he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Murphy, &ldquo;he comes aboard, removes all the stores he can&mdash;particularly
      engine oil&mdash;and strips the vessel of all her brass, copper and bronze
      fittings. These metals are very scarce in Germany and they need all they
      can get in the manufacture of munitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct! And we must bear in mind, Mike, the fact that a German is
      naturally thrifty; if he can sink a ship with shell fire or bombs set in
      her bilges he will not waste on her a torpedo that costs from ten to
      twenty thousand dollars. Now, will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my plan is absurdly simple. We merely provide a gorgeous opportunity
      for the enemy; we inculcate in him the idea that he is about to pick a
      soft one&mdash;then: Alas, poor Yorick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael J. Murphy rose and put on his hat. &ldquo;Where are you going, Mike?&rdquo;
       Cappy demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going up to the navy yard at Mare Island,&rdquo; the port captain declared,
      &ldquo;to see if I cannot pick up a couple of six-inch rifles of the model they
      used when I was in the navy. They're obsolete now, but I understand them&mdash;and
      while I'm getting the guns I'll pick up four or five old navy men. Leave
      it to me, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give 'em hell!&rdquo; shouted Cappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will!&rdquo; quoth Michael J. Murphy with conviction.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two weeks later the old <i>Costa Rica,</i> looking somewhat youthful in a
      new coat of black paint and with a huge American flag painted on each
      topside, slipped quietly out of San Francisco in ballast and for the last
      time turned her nose toward Panama. In the brief period given him in which
      to overhaul her interior, Terence P. Reardon had accomplished wonders, and
      an hour after Mike Murphy had taken his bearings from Point San Pedro and
      laid out his course the chief came into the chart room to announce that
      the old girl was doing eight knots and, barring unexpected bad weather,
      would continue to do it without falling to pieces. &ldquo;If I could have spint
      two thousand dollars more on her,&rdquo; Terence declared, &ldquo;I believe I could
      get another knot out av her. Time was whin she could do sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy Ricks, enjoying his afternoon cigar in the snug chart room, snorted
      vigorously. &ldquo;I don't very often take a notion to throw my money into the
      sea, Terence,&rdquo; he reminded his port engineer, &ldquo;but when I do get that
      reckless I limit myself to twenty thousand dollars, and that, in round
      figures, is what this old ruin will stand me about the time the torpedo
      blows you up on top of the fiddle. However, that is a trifling investment
      if we succeed in destroying a late-type German submarine with a couple of
      hundred thousand dollars' worth of torpedoes aboard. As a sporting
      proposition it's somewhat more expensive than golf, but the excitement
      makes up for the added cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old box is alive with rats and bedbugs,&rdquo; Murphy complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they annoy you, Mike, my boy, comfort yourself with the thought that
      they're all going to be drowned,&rdquo; Cappy replied gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the old packet wallowed down the coast, the while her crew, under
      Mike Murphy's supervision, built gun platforms fore and aft. Following
      their completion, the two six-inch guns Cappy had succeeded in getting
      from the navy were lifted out of the hold with the aid of the cargo winch
      and placed in position, one forward and the other aft. Thereupon the mate
      took charge of the <i>Costa Rica,</i> while Mike Murphy drilled his crew
      in range finding and celerity in loading the piece. Pointing the gun was
      entirely up to Murphy and, needless to state, the task was in capable
      hands, as was frequently demonstrated during target practice as they
      loafed down the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arrival at Panama the <i>Costa Rica's</i> bunkers were replenished
      and an extra supply of sacked coal was piled on deck, for with her
      patched-up boilers the old steamer was a hog on fuel. Then the mechanics
      and carpenters and all men not vitally needed aboard for the remainder of
      the voyage were put ashore and furnished with transportation back to San
      Francisco by the regular Pacific Mail liner. Next, the name on the bows of
      the <i>Costa Rica</i> was painted out, the name boards at each end of her
      bridge removed and the raised-letter record of her identity and home port
      chipped off her stern; following which Cappy Ricks, Terence P. Reardon and
      Michael J. Murphy commended their souls to their Creator, and the <i>Costa
      Rica</i> slipped leisurely through the ditch and out into the Caribbean
      Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourteen days later Mike Murphy dropped round to Cappy Ricks' cabin.
      &ldquo;We're in the danger zone, sir,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;And from now on we're
      liable to meet one of the larger type of U-boats that operate a couple of
      thousand miles from the base at Zeebrugge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Cappy replied calmly. &ldquo;Whether torpedoed or shelled, your
      instructions are the same. Forbid the wireless operator to send out a call
      for help, heave to immediately and get the men into the boats and away
      from the ship. Terry Reardon will remain on duty in the engine room,
      provided it isn't wrecked by a torpedo and the engine room crew killed;
      you and your gun crew will remain aboard and hide in the forecastle if
      it's action front, and in the auxiliary steering-gear house if it's action
      rear. I will relieve the quartermaster, take charge of the wheel and
      direct the action. If I see that there isn't going to be any action we'll
      put on life preservers, jump overboard and be picked up by our men in the
      boats. However, something tells me, Mike, that we're going to have a crack
      at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant something rapped the <i>Costa Rica</i> terrifically
      on the starboard side amidships and tore through her with a grinding,
      wrenching noise, followed by an explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the crack you were speaking of, sir,&rdquo; Murphy yelled and started
      for the door. Cappy Ricks grasped him frantically by the arm. &ldquo;Was that a
      shell or a torpedo?&rdquo; he cried. His voice, thin and shrill with age,
      quavered now with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a shell,&rdquo; Murphy answered. &ldquo;Went through the second cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that German belongs to Alden P. Ricks,&rdquo; Cappy declared, and scurried
      for the pilot house. &ldquo;Out and into life-boats!&rdquo; he ordered the
      quartermaster, and shoved him away from the wheel. &ldquo;Set her over to slow
      speed ahead,&rdquo; he called to the mate, who was standing stupidly, gazing at
      the white puffs of smoke that marked the position of the submarine two
      miles off the starboard bow. The mate came to life, jammed over the handle
      of the marine telegraph and, obeying an order bellowed to him by Mike
      Murphy from the main deck, abandoned the bridge for the boat deck, there
      to superintend the task of getting the men away from the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thrill of excitement having subsided, Cappy carefully drew the
      little half curtains on the pilot-house window, leaving a small slit
      through which he could observe the submarine without being observed
      himself, for it was no part of his plan to disclose to the enemy the fact
      that the ship was not entirely deserted&mdash;and that the submarine
      commander should jump to the conclusion that she was deserted by all hands
      was precisely the condition that Cappy desired to bring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the engine room the indomitable Terence Reardon, with one hand on
      the throttle and one eye on the steam gauge, put the <i>Costa Rica</i>
      under a dead-slow bell; she seemed scarcely to move, yet she had
      sufficient steerage way to enable Cappy to keep her pointed in the general
      direction of the submarine, the commander of which, seeing the crew of the
      Costa Rica scurrying for the boats, contented himself with sending over
      half a dozen shells for the purpose of hurrying them along; then he ceased
      firing, and when the boats pulled out from the ship in tow of a motor
      lifeboat and his powerful glasses showed neither guns nor sign of life
      upon the <i>Costa Rica's</i> decks, he did exactly what Cappy Ricks
      figured he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He circled warily round his prize, but the absence of frantic wireless
      calls for help lulled his suspicions, and presently he bore down upon her,
      hove to two cable lengths abreast the wallowing hulk and watched her fully
      five minutes for a possible trap, for the absence of any name puzzled him.
      His suspicions subsided at length, however, the hatch in her turtle deck
      slid back and men appeared, dragging up a small collapsible boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, slowly&mdash;so gradually that it seemed the old vessel was merely
      drifting, Cappy brought the <i>Costa Rica</i> round until her bow pointed
      toward the submarine. Mike Murphy, standing just inside the forecastle
      door, kept his glance on the slit in the curtains on the pilot-house
      window-and presently Cappy motioned violently to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the gun!&rdquo; ordered the captain. Followed by his gun crew he dashed out
      of the forecastle and up the companion ladder to the forecastle head. A
      jerk at a lever connecting a cunningly constructed set of controls, and
      the false topsides on the forecastle head flopped to the deck, revealing
      Mike Murphy's six-inch gun. Cappy saw him deflect the gun while another
      man traversed it; for five seconds his eyes pressed the sight, and when
      the gun remained motionless Cappy knew that the hull of the submarine was
      looming fairly on the intersection of the cross wires in the sight. The
      range was point-blank!
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as were Murphy and his crew, however, the gun crew of the submarine
      was quicker. Before the <i>Costa Rica's</i> gun was properly laid, a shell
      from the submarine flew a foot over the heads of the Murphyites and burst
      fifty yards beyond the ship. &ldquo;Ah, missed!&rdquo; breathed Michael J. and raised
      his hand. The gunner released the firing pin and the six-inch projectile
      with which the gun had been loaded for two days crashed into the submarine
      at her water line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrific explosion followed the shot. Cappy Ricks, gazing popeyed with
      horror, saw the submarine disintegrate and disappear in a huge
      water-spout; when the water settled only a vast and widening smear of
      heavy fuel oil showed where she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the forecastle head Michael Murphy yelled to Cappy Ricks. &ldquo;Well, are
      you satisfied, sir?&rdquo; On his part, Cappy, jubilant, even in the instant
      when he knew thirty new faces were already whining round the devil, dashed
      out on the bridge, seized the whistle cord and swung on it. A sad,
      nautical sob from the <i>Costa Rica's</i> siren answered him, and ten
      seconds later Terence Reardon whistled up the bridge. Cappy let go the
      whistle cord and took up the speaking tube. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he piped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the divil do ye mean be blowin' that whistle?&rdquo; roared Terence,
      thinking he was addressing the mate. &ldquo;Wit' me alone in the engine room how
      d'ye expect me to keep shteam up on this ould hooker wit' you blowin' it
      off in the whistle! Take shame to yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike sunk the submarine! Mike sunk the submarine!&rdquo; Cappy shrilled over
      and over again. &ldquo;Come up, Terence, and see the oil. See the oil, Terence,
      see the oil! Mike sunk the submarine, Mike sunk it. Bully for Mike! Oh,
      bully! Bully! Bully! Mike sunk it, but I schemed it. Come up, Terence, I'm
      going to faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with shrill yips of delirious delight he slid down the companion
      to the main deck, to be gathered in Michael J. Murphy's arms and hugged
      and passed to the gun crew, who hoisted him to their shoulders and paraded
      joyously and blasphemously round the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you he wouldn't use a torpedo if he could do the trick with
      shells,&rdquo; Gappy shouted. &ldquo;I told you he'd board us if we didn't wireless
      for help. Ha, ha, ha! Te-hee!&rdquo; And he burst into shrill cachinnations. &ldquo;I
      out-thought the scoundrel&mdash;goin' to get a patent on my idea&mdash;turn
      it over to the Government&mdash;oh, Mike! Oh, Terence! Get the steward
      back aboard. We must have some liquor. They used to serve grog in the old
      navy after a victory, didn't they? Yi-yi-yi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terence P. Reardon came up and proffered his greasy paw, the while his
      quizzical glance swept the oily sea. &ldquo;Well, sor,&rdquo; he remarked
      philosophically, &ldquo;what wit' bein' a Christian I'm a little bit sorry the
      Dutchman lost, but back av that again I'm a little bit glad we won.
      Michael, do you get those blackguards o' mine down below as quick as ye
      can, or we'll be all day gettin' shteam up agin in this ould brute av a
      ship.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days passed uneventfully; then shortly before sunset on the third day
      the look-out reported a periscope about a thousand yards distant and three
      points off the port bow. Cappy Ricks' old knees promptly commenced to
      knock together with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's where Terence gets that torpedo if he doesn't come up out of the
      engine room,&rdquo; Mike Murphy remarked laconically, and promptly whistled
      Terence on the engine room speaking tube. &ldquo;Come up or be blown up,&rdquo; he
      yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a fear! We're comin',&rdquo; Terence replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief and his crew had just reached the deck when the black shining
      turtleback of the submarine broke water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have to come to the surface to discharge a torpedo,&rdquo; Murphy
      explained to Cappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Godfrey! Here it comes!&rdquo; shrilled Cappy, and watched, fascinated,
      the wake of the torpedo as it raced toward them. Just as Terence Reardon
      and his engine crew came panting up on the bridge, the old <i>Costa Rica</i>
      walked into it. &ldquo;Me ingine room! I knew it!&rdquo; cried Terence. Then the
      explosion came.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where he lay on his back, half stunned, Cappy Ricks saw water and
      wreckage fly high in the air. The <i>Costa Rica</i> shivered. So did
      Cappy. Then the debris descended, and Cappy, choked with salt water, dimly
      realized that Terence Reardon had him in his arms and was carrying him
      down to the boat deck, where the motor lifeboat swung wide in the davits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take the boss from me,&rdquo; Terence commanded, and passed Cappy to a
      negro fireman, who carried the old man forward and laid him on a pile of
      blankets, previously placed there for just such an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lifeboat commenced to drop away from the towering black topside
      and Cappy was aware of Michael J. Murphy's face&mdash;white, anxious,
      terrified&mdash;gazing down at him from the ship's rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just suffering from the shock,&rdquo; Cappy called. &ldquo;Mike, you 'tend to
      business. Remember what I told you and tell the crew to keep their mouths
      shut. He'll do the natural thing and walk into your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murphy, reassured, waved his hand, and with his gun crew fled aft to the
      little house that protected the auxiliary steering gear from the weather,
      where they concealed themselves. In the meantime the other lifeboats had
      been lowered away; the painter from the third boat was passed to the
      second, which in turn passed its painter to the motor boat, and the ship's
      company hauled clear of the shattered, sinking ship. The <i>Costa Rica</i>
      was going down by the head, and Cappy, curious as any human being, sat up
      to watch his decoy disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The submarine steamed up to them. &ldquo;What vessel is that?&rdquo; her commander
      shouted from the conning tower in excellent English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American steamer <i>Soak-it-to-'em</i>, of Rotten Row,&rdquo; Cappy Ricks
      replied, &ldquo;carrying a cargo of post holes. She has three decks and no
      bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you spell the name?&rdquo; the German bawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't hear you,&rdquo; Cappy fibbed. Then, <i>sotto voce</i>, to Mr. Reardon:
      &ldquo;Kick her ahead, Terry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you spell the name?&rdquo; the submarine captain repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cappy jibbered something unintelligible, and Mr. Reardon added to the
      puzzle by bellowing the information that the <i>p</i> was silent, as in
      pneumonia. All this time the motor boat was putting distance between
      itself and the submarine, and the disgusted German, as a last resort,
      steamed away and circled round the rapidly lifting stern of the doomed <i>Costa
      Rica</i>, confident that there he would find the record of her identity
      and home port&mdash;information which, in his methodical German way, he
      desired to include in his official report to the Admiralty. And while he
      ratched slowly past, striving to find with his binoculars that which was
      not, Michael J. Murphy and his bully boys came aft with a rush, tore aside
      the tarpaulin that screened the stern gun and expeditiously opened fire.
      To Cappy Ricks' horror Murphy's first shot was a clean miss, and instantly
      the big sub started to submerge with a hoarse sucking sound that brought
      despair to Cappy Ricks' heart. She was halfway under before Murphy's gun
      was reloaded, but quite calmly the gun was traversed and deflected until
      the black stern flashed across the intersection of the wires in the sight;
      then Murphy's hand dropped and the gun roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do nicely, lads,&rdquo; he told his crew. &ldquo;Tore the stern off her that
      time; and from this dive she'll not come up. Cappy Ricks was right. He
      banked on human nature, and if curiosity isn't a human trait then I'm a
      Chinaman. Overboard with you, and away before the old girl goes under or
      we'll be sucked down in the vortex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And overboard they went, to be picked up five minutes later by Terence and
      Cappy in the motor lifeboat. &ldquo;You were right, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; cried Murphy as
      he scrambled into the boat. &ldquo;Curiosity killed the cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it's blamed near killed me,&rdquo; Cappy declared feebly. &ldquo;Some of
      that debris came down and hit me a slap on the dome&mdash;Jerusalem! There
      goes my decoy&mdash;peace to her bones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Costa Rica</i> dove to the Port of Missing Ships. Michael J.
      Murphy, however, did not turn to see her disappear; he was gazing,
      instead, at a thin red trickle that came from under Cappy's cap band and
      was running down his wizened neck. &ldquo;Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; he said anxiously, &ldquo;you're
      wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cappy rubbed the sore spot, and when he withdrew his fingers they were
      bloody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Holy Pink-Toed Prophet!&rdquo; he gasped wonderingly. &ldquo;You're right,
      Mike. I've been wounded in action with the enemies of my country! So help
      me, Mike. I've actually lived to shed my blood for the Stars and Stripes,
      like any other Ricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed wonderingly at Mike Murphy. &ldquo;Now I can die happy,&rdquo; he murmured.
      &ldquo;I've done my bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, begorra,&rdquo; rumbled Terence P. Reardon, &ldquo;an' if I have my way about it
      ye're honorably discharged from the service this minute, Misther Ricks.
      I'll gallivant no more wit' you in ye're ould breadbaskets av shteamers.
      'Tis highly dangerous an' no business for a man of family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy grinned at his colleague. &ldquo;For all that, Terence,&rdquo; he
      declared, &ldquo;you must admit that Mr. Ricks' scheme for destroying submarines
      is the only practical one yet devised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for ye, Michael. But shtill, like all fine invintions, the idjea
      has its dhrawbacks. Now if we could only be sure av a continyous supply av
      ould ships for use as decoys&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a smudge of smoke,&rdquo; cried Gappy Ricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike Murphy followed the old man's pointing finger. &ldquo;There's only one kind
      of boat makes a smudge like that,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and it's a destroyer.
      Safe and well out of a glorious adventure. Faith, we're the lucky devils;
      and by this and by that, I'll enlist aboard that destroyer, now that I'm
      here on the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;an' good luck to you!&rdquo; murmured Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Cappy Ricks, and fingered his trifling but honorable wound.
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If Skinner could only know a thrill like this!&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
